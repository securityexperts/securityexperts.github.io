<p>While every homeowner worries about burglaries, apprehension has actually surrounded home security systems due to their traditionally high expenses, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use user interfaces frequently resulting in false alarms. A security camera system is a whole video surveillance system connected together by a series of security cameras and network video recorders, providing reputable video monitoring around your home and business. 145 years ago, we created security and alarm monitoring services.

In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls should be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal guard. Numerous cities likewise require an authorization to even run a home and own security system. Rules such as these are developed to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Lots of municipalities will fine you for too many incorrect alarms.</p>

Protect America subcontracts its monitoring services to POLICE OFFICERS Monitoring, an acclaimed, UL-certified company with six across the country monitoring stations and a 16.2-second typical top priority alarm response time.
