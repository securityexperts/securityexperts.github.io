<p>Costs for systems vary. Bigger systems that provide full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most expensive choices. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most budget-friendly option. Remember that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end.

<p>A wired security camera can come in 2 types, both requiring wires to provide power and for the purposes of video transmission.
