<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent however good-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.

<p>What really sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be expensive but is important. In truth, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to include the subscription. Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, personalized Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of view), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera discovered activity. Being able to distinguish between an individual and a cars and truck, for example, enables you to cut down on unnecessary signals.
