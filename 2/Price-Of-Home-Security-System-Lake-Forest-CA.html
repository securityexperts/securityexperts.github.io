<p>Ring may not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), however it sure has acquired rather the excitement over the years. We've been evaluating Ring Alarm a fair bit lately, and we in fact like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security package that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring fees. Or ... no monitoring fees at all if you choose the complimentary self-monitor" alternative.</p>
<p>But monitored systems likewise tend to have a service contract, which locks you into paying an often-pricey monthly cost for a set amount of time, usually one to 5 years. No-contract systems, which enable you to spend for monitoring services on a month-to-month basis rather than committing to a long-term arrangement, are ending up being more common. These systems in some cases cost more in advance for the hardware than professional systems that use a discount rate in exchange for that prolonged service agreement. Spending for the equipment in advance offers you with a great deal of control over what you get, where you can put it, and how you utilize the service. And you can stop the monitoring and start service as many times as you desire.</p>
