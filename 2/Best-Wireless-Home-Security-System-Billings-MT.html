<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see at night. If capturing video footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has a lot of IR LEDs.</p>
