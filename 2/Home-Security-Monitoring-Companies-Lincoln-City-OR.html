<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system prevents talking to someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a house owner forgets their secrets and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a community feline, it can set off the alarm. With an expertly monitored system, the property owner will be contacted by the monitoring company whenever the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it quickly. False alarms occur. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, property owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>
