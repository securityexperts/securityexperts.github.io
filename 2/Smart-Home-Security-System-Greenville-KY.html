<p>The motion detection is excellent, and the app is a pleasure to use too (a lot better than the apps you get with some spending plan security cameras), though if you want to enter its cleverest customisations, there is a bit of a learning curve.

<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to detect it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only an incorrect complacency because it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
