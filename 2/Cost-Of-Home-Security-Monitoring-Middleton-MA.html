<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the extreme environment.</p>
<p>The passive infrared (PIR) motion detector is among the most typical sensors discovered in household and small business environments. It uses inexpensive and reliable performance. The term passive refers to the reality that the detector does not create or radiate its own energy; it works entirely by spotting the heat given off by other objects. </p>
