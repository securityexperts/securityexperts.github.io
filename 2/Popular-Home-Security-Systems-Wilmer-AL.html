<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the precise very same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the burglar alarm. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
