<h3>Digital Security Systems Bountiful UT 84010</h3>
<p>A number of other designs were disqualified due to efficiency problems. We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

We also found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
