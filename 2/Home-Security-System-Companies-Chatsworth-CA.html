<p>Since it's more complex than it needs to be, we don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, notifies, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for thirty days.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
