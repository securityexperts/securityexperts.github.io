<p>Nothing is more vital than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You don't have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your property and possessions. In case your alarm is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security specialists are waiting to react by instantaneously getting in touch with you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or cops authorities.</p>
<p>We didn't think about alarm that needed expert installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, featured long and usually onerous contracts, and frequently depend on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they offer little benefit. A fine example is the Vivint system, which we have actually reviewed independently and do not advise for many people.</p>
