The opportunity that the fixed camera would be pointed in the instructions of the event depends upon the initial requirements for area of coverage. If there are three select fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single set camera can just enjoy one. This produces a one in three chance of capturing a specific event on video (either live or taped). The command center likewise included a computer system designated for filing event reports online.

Night vision is included too, for when the lights go out. </p>
