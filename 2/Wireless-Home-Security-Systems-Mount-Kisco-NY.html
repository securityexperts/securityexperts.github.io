<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" freely sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to identify it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just an incorrect sense of security because it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
