<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first question you should be asking is which of these companies is offering your information to third party companies? I have actually ditched my Nest Cams since they were bought by Google. Something we all need to consider. Sirens. So your camera has discovered intruders or wild animals. Do you want to scare them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens might violate local sound control laws, so check ahead of time prior to making the purchase.</p>
<p>Moreover they can not send fluid video, just still frame images or low resolution bits of video. Blink Security Cameras are a good example of a system we are constantly helping consumers replace.

<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can determine individuals the camera is finding utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those people and will send out mobile phone signals with that info when they appear at your home. We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to distinguish anticipated visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to determine faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
