<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to record clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
