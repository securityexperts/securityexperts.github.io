<p>This clever smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout testing, we found it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly triggering when motion was spotted. We enjoy that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For many homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it needs to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
