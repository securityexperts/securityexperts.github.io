If you want a dependable home security camera for both indoors and out that doesn't cost too much, you can't beat the Arlo Pro 2.

<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally described as shock sensing units, are different because they are installed on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which take a trip through the glass and typically through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling. Generally, the most extreme frequencies created are between 3 and 5 kHz, depending on the kind of glass and the existence of a plastic interlayer. Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn create an alarm condition.</p>

<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We must keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based on available bandwidth, which could change throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
