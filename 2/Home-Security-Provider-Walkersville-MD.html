However, after almost 2 years of night, day and use images have actually constantly been clear, and we never had issues with the camera missing motion, an issue we experienced when checking the Wyze Cam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a smart function you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion detected. We've seen it highlight moths, mice, and vehicles.</p>
