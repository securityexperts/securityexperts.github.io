<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most technologically innovative outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of vision.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it cuts down on false alarms, and it can even identify people you have actually labeled (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
