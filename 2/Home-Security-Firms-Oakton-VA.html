<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>The report, entitled Is your CCTV system secure from cyber attack?, says there are "major vulnerabilities" in both conventional DVR-based CCTV systems, along with cloud-based video systems. Hackers can "easily" pirate connections to the device's IP address, putting a lot of people, their properties and information at threat. </p>
