<h2>Security Camera Systems And Surveillance Massena</h2>
<p>While some parts might be affected temporarily by a power outage, cellular and landline systems will continue to work even if there's no electrical power. Cellular systems utilize cell towers to communicate with the monitoring center in addition to a battery backup that can keep them up and running for several hours until the electric service is brought back. Landline systems use standard phone lines to communicate with the monitoring center and, similar to cellular systems, they typically have a battery backup to keep them working for a set period of time.</p>
<p>IP security cameras capture analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing abilities like compression and motion detection. The recorded digital video stream is then broadcast over a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable television to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which records each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and evaluation. The system can be set up to interact through network or mobile app for viewing.</p>

Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and shutting off the system will end this procedure with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
