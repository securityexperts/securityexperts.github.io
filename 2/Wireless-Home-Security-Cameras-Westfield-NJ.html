If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially read the What about Ring? section from our smart video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video items, we do not believe that these problems alter the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our current recommendation.</p>
