Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false sense of security because it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
