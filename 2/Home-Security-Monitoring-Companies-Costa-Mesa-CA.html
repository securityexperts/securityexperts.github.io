<p>When using IP cameras - as a lot of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that usually powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for further wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras might require less electrical wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, generally via 110VAC power. </p>
