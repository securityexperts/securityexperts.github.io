<h3>The Best Home Alarm System Malvern PA 19355</h3>
<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 monthly, which could be an inexpensive alternative for customers in rural areas. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're a lot more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't offered. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
<p>What to think about: Basic cellular alarm monitoring is $39.99 each month, but you'll pay a little more if you want to include extra functions, like a security camera. While a typical contract runs 42 months (among the longer agreement terms on our list), that requirement is only for users who want to lease their equipment. Vivint has no minimum agreement requirement if you buy your equipment upfront.</p>
