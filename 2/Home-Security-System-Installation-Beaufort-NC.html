<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal performance. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera close to the NVR is definitely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is a fantastic alternative for long range situations where trees and poles are not present.</p>
<p>The big bonus offer is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a gadget that does not look like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency situation services direct from the app if you see a disruption, and it hardly ever sends false signals since it tracks your phone (and other member of the family's phones), so comprehends when you're at home and turns everything off. Likewise, it will equip itself immediately when everyone has actually left.</p>

<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your house so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the porch by a licensed electrician (who takes place to be my spouse).
