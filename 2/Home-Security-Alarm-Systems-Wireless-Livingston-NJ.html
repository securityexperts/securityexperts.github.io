<p>The biggest disadvantage of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets activated while you're away, you have no visual means of verifying if something is really wrong and how severe the scenario is. If the alarm occurrence is identified to be a false alarm, the city will send by mail a billing summarizing the occurrence and evaluating a charge, if any.</p>
