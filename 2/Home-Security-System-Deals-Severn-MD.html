With this in mind, video surveillance is the act of observing something with the aid of electronic monitoring and video recording.

Wired security systems are also vulnerable to power failures. Most will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of an outage, but long term interruptions will lead to the system losing power. When choosing a wired system, it's likewise crucial to consider how long you plan to remain at the very same home. They are not portable and can't move with you because these security systems are incorporated into the home's wiring.</p>
