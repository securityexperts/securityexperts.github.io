<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and then combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and space appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as many CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the large amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at very quick speeds, and typically over cross countries. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cables are reliable, however not suitable with IP cameras. In most cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further circuitry. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not linked to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls but will still require cable televisions to power the security camera individually, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
