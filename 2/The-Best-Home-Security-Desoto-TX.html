<p>Are independently owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the exact same method as public cameras? We likewise need to draw fine lines about 'Who actually is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who fixes a limit in between public interest and harassment? At the moment, nobody! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They could peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing viewing outside a window it could be a criminal activity, yet the same individual might place a surveillance camera then from another location view a person within the privacy of their home.

<p>Our experience with expert installation was mixed. Our tester said the service technician offered solid customer service: He dropped a few unnecessary window sensors from my bill after choosing that the motion detector was sufficient for the whole front half of my home." However, there were some concerns with connecting the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
