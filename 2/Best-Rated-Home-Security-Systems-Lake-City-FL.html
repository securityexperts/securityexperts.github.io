<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All things give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy emitted by an item is known as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it discharges. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of spotting small differences in temperature. The device gathers the infrared radiation from things in the scene and creates an electronic image based on details about the temperature distinctions. Since things are hardly ever precisely the same temperature as other things around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will appear as unique in a thermal image.</p>
