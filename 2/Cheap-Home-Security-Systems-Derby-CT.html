<p>Absolutely nothing is more crucial than protecting what you treasure most ... your household and home. You do not need to invest in a multi-million dollar surveillance system to watch on your residential or commercial property and ownerships.

When a patient presses the emergency situation button, it sends dual signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if required, might merely press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific flooring.</p>
