<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its downplayed looks and face recognition software. The latter allows you to see exactly when a particular person gets to your house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner appeared on time. However Netatmo has actually broadened its security variety with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Presence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof doors and window sensors called Tags (₤ 89.99). They also plan to launch a smart smoke alarm and siren later this year, which makes this an even better proposal.</p>
