We contacted consumer support, which used a free replacement unit-- although the warranty had long given that expired.</p>
<p>We don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam since it's more complex than it ought to be. Recordings, alerts, and combination all require different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are saved for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
