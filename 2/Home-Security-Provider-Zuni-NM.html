Security cameras present near a dumpster can discourage this activity.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is top quality, if not particularly cutting-edge, so we're really advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free plan choice. Sure, you get a lower rate if you opt for a three-year contract, however considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying agreement if you cancel, it's a big dedication.

We think this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to want to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) likewise offer a wider series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
