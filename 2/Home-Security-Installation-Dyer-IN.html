Set a temporary password and reset it as quickly as you return if you go on vacation and have someone coming over to inspect or feed pets on your home. As newer security systems shift to cloud-based, wireless platforms, it is necessary to safeguard yourself versus network intrusion just as you would with protecting your identity and virtual assets online.</p>
