<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened location in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a brightened room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see at night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
