We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
