<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face acknowledgment.

We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
