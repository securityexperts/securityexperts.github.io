<p>Since it's more complicated than it ought to be, we do not suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, signals, and integration all require separate IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are saved for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly cost (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for thirty days.

We had problems with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also afflicted with fuzzy night vision and left gaps (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.
