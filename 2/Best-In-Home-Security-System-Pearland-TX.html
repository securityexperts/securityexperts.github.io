The regulation was modified and entered into effect on June 1, 2013.

<p>MAC filtering is effective only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it provides protection only when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to detect it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect sense of security given that it avoids just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
