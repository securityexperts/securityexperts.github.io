If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it pertains to video products, we do not believe that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we stay confident in our present recommendation.</p>
