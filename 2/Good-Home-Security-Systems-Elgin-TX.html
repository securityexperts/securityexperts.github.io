<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
