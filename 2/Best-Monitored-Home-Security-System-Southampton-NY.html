<p>Nevermind how excellent the cameras are. The first concern you should be asking is which of these companies is selling your data to third party companies? I've dropped my Nest Cams given that they were bought by Google. Something all of us require to think about. Sirens. So your camera has spotted burglars or wild animals. Do you want to frighten them off? A blast from a 100+ decibel siren will work. Note that these sirens might breach local sound control laws, so inspect ahead of time before making the purchase.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
