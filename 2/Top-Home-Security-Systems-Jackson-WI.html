<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients understand that the affordable consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
