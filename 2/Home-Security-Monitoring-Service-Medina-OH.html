<p>The Nest Cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were excellent in our screening-- during the day and in the evening-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We should keep in mind that the camera would sometimes downgrade the picture quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may defeat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
