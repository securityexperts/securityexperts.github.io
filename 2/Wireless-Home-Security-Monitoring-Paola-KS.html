IP cameras also have additional features that analog cameras do not provide, such as video analytics, which permit mobile alerts and automated recording if there is motion within the camera's field of vision.

<h2>Alarms, CCTV And Safes Paola</h2>
<p>In the past, a surveillance security system typically consisted of several cameras linked-- either hardwired or wireless-- to a digital video recorder (DVR), which tape-recorded the images and displayed them on a closed circuit television (CCTV) or monitor.
