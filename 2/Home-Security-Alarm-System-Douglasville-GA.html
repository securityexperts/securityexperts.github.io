<h3>Wireless Alarm Companies in Douglasville GA</h3>
<p>Unlike traditional alarm systems, which have a control board (usually situated in the entrance hall) that is utilized to disarm the alarm and equip and alert you if any sensing units have actually been activated, smart alarms are controlled from a mobile phone app. The app lets you arm and disarm the alarm, even if you have actually already left home, and alerts you if any of the sensing units have actually been set off, rather than getting home to discover your siren has actually been sounding all afternoon (and potentially irritating your neighbours).

If you have big pets, you might wish to think about avoiding the motion sensors and rely more on the doors and window sensors which aren't triggered by motion but are set off when a window or door is opened.</p>
