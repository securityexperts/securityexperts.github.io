<p>Camera compatibility: Not every video recorder can work with every camera. Obviously, DVRs require analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, but the compatibility concern extends well beyond that difference. Some NVR systems, for instance, work with the IP cameras only from certain manufacturers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you need to first make sure that the gadget will deal with the cameras you have actually purchased.
