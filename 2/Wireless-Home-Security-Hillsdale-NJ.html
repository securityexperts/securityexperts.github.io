<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Invite camera (₤ 199), with its understated looks and face acknowledgment software. The latter allows you to see exactly when a specific individual arrives at your home - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. But Netatmo has expanded its security range with a dazzling outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a 3 pack of weatherproof doors and window sensing units called Tags (₤ 89.99). They likewise plan to release a smart smoke detector and siren later this year, that makes this an even better proposal.</p>

It costs a lot, its rates isn't always transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to discuss that the customer service experience differs widely depending upon the dealership you opt for. </p>
