The field of view is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180).

Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
