<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually set up on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who occurs to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
