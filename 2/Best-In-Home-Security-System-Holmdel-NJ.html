<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" easily transmits its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no unique equipment or software application to identify it. Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transferring 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides only an incorrect complacency given that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational infrastructure and not does anything to avoid a directed attack.</p>
