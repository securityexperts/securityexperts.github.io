<p>I explained that all we would require to do is tap into any among the emergency situation call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise consisted of two-way audio, and that camera would become the user interface into the VMS system. When a patient pushes the emergency situation button, it sends dual notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Moreover, if the central patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if required, could merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

So why isn't it a pick? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notifications and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is poor. Also, if the camera is in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings modifications-- it can't multitask.</p>
