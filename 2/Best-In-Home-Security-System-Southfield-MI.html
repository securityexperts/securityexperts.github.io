<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.

Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
