I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send informs, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>

The camera records 1080p videos with a 147-degree wide angle lens that minimizes all blind spots and gives you access to a broader field of vision than most cameras. It is also geared up with a 3x digital zoom function that enables you to focus and record details such as facial features in case of break-ins.</p>
