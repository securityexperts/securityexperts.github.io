With the long USB cord, I was able location the camera around 10 feet away from my desk intending into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without problem. The IR lights during the night are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle.

<h3>Home Security Service Providers in Maryland</h3>
<p>The 2nd essential thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill built-in alarm, so it works as a home alarm as well as a security camera. That distinguishes it from the products I've currently composed, and helps in part to discuss its rate. This Canary Flex is a home security camera that packs a huge punch in a little package. It works either linked to power or with its integrated battery-- and it's the only Canary camera that you can utilize within and outdoors.</p>
