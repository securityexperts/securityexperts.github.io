The Ring Stick Up Webcam can be found in wired and battery versions, which can be used inside your home and outdoors. But neither can tape continually, and they both require the Ring Protect strategy to capture recordings. Likewise, the wired version normally left gaps of as much as 7 seconds in between 1-minute recordings, while the battery version left about a minute in between 30-second clips. Both likewise do not have person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to minimize false alerts.</p>

We are confirming with Arlo whether our unit was defective, therefore we might revisit this review.</p>
