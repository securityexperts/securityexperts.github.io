<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are 3 times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes an advantage called ASAPer, which at the same time messages a group of pre-set contacts to determine whether alarm activity is a true emergency or false alarm.

<p>If you do come across a home invasion emergency situation, you can activate the 80dB alarm. I am a little dissatisfied by the volume of the alarm. At 80dB, it's about as loud as a food processor whereas numerous other alarm systems are as loud as 90dB and even 105dB. Regardless of that, the alarm needs to suffice to frighten trespassers most of the times. To recover costs and hold alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works directly with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company must be accredited, pay any registration or incorrect alarm fees, and provide physical proof like camera video or a damaged window to warrant cops reaction.</p>
