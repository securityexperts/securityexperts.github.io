<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens.

This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
