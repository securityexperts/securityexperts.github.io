<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom might not do. They might peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side.
