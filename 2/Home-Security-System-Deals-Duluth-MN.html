<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too quickly, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

<p>There's no dedicated center involved here - each camera connects directly to your router by means of Wi-Fi, and streams to your phone (or to the outside world) from there.

'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big sibling? The Corporates? Or harassing neighbour? Who fixes a limit between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera might lawfully do what a peeping tom might not do. They might peer inside of windows with the complete protection of the law on their side.
