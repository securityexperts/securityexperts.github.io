A fine example is the Vivint system, which we've examined separately and don't advise for most people.</p>
<h2>Wireless CCTV Camera Hampshire</h2>

Surveillance cameras are likewise manufactured in these two resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the much better, right? Yes and no. There are some tricky consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not constantly better.</p>
