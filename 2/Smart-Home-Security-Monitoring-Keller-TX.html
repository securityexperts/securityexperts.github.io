<h3>Motion Activated Security Camera Keller TX 76244</h3>

If there are no as-built files providing performance and configuration info to make this combination work, there are only 2 alternatives.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is finding utilizing face recognition.

We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a neighboring TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
