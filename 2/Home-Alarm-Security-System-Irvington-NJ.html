<p>A taut wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally mounted on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are created to detect any physical effort to penetrate the barrier. Tight wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by adjusting the sensing units to overlook items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
