Which implies if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical present to flow throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the alarm system will set off.</p>
