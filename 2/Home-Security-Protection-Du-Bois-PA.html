<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were integrated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had installed on the patio by a licensed electrician (who occurs to be my spouse). All of the cameras were connected to the very same 2.4 GHz network via a Wi-Fi router inside (roughly 40 feet from the cameras); service to the house was Verizon Fios.</p>

These companies developed their equipment this way to make consumers stay with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies means hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. Alexa assistance is consisted of, as you would expect from an Amazon-owned brand name, and the camera competently handles all the normal functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is consisted of too, for when the lights go out. </p>
