<p>I explained that all we would require to do is tap into any among the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, and that camera would end up being the user interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency button, it sends double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, suggesting that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would assess the danger and, if needed, might simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
