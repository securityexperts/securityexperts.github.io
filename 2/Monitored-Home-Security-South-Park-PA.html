<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it offers protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering provides just a false complacency considering that it avoids only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
