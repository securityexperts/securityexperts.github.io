<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the extreme environment.</p>
