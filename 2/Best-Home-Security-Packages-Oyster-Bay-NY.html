<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Web cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>
