<p>Seismic glass-break detectors, generally referred to as shock sensing units, are different because they are set up on the glass pane. When glass breaks it produces particular shock frequencies which travel through the glass and frequently through the window frame and the surrounding walls and ceiling.

Seismic glass-break detectors feel these shock frequencies and in turn produce an alarm condition.</p>

<h3>Monitored Burglar Alarm Jefferson OH 44047</h3>
