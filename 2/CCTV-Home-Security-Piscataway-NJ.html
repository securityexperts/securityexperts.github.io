<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>You can pick from SimpliSafe's original award-winning system or their most recent line of equipment. Both systems provide exceptional, reliable home security. With the more recent system, you will pay more, but that greater rate includes a system that is smaller, faster, and stronger. At half the size of the original system, the tiny sensors are practically unnoticeable. The new system works 5 times much faster, and the alarm is 50% louder to frighten trespassers. </p>
