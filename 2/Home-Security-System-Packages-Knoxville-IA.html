<p>The cost of admission for the Deep Sentinel Home Security system isn't that high, even at $499, because it consists of 3 outdoor cameras with two-way audio. And the $50-per-month membership cost sounds pricey, but it's not a lot when you consider that a live human being is seeing a live feed whenever the cameras detect suspicious activity.

I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send signals, you can't manage it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
