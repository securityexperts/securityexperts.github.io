<p>Home security should never be restricted by where you can position or power your cameras, inside or outdoors.

<p>We didn't think about alarm that needed professional installation. Pro-installed systems typically cost more, use equipment similar to that of Do It Yourself systems, included long and generally difficult agreements, and often depend on the same monitoring companies that self-installed systems use, so they use little advantage.

At the same time, if you do not have a home automation center, look for a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth lock that includes its own mobile app. Smart locks use standard pre-drilled holes and are fairly simple to install. Some models use your existing keyed cylinder and deadbolt hardware and connect to the within your door, while others need that you eliminate your existing exterior and interior escutcheons and change the deadbolt and strike hardware.</p>
