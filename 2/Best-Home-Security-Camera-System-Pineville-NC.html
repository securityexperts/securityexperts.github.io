When a client presses the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. In addition, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the risk and, if needed, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
