We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is produced by something with the same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false alerts). However, you do need to sign up for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have actually been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are offered that have key fobs and additional sensors, too.</p>

<p>Lighting: Lots of security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see in the evening. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video in the dark is a concern.</p>
