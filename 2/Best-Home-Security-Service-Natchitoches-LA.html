That's why Allied Universal Â® security specialists are trained to go the extra mile with an ambassador-level method to customer service that aligns with your high-end brand name image and promotes personal privacy and comfort.</p>
<p>Just recently, Ring denied reports that it had suffered an information breach, but we agree with its recommendation that users should reset passwords and enable two-factor authentication as a preventive step. All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events. Nevertheless, after this most current entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? section from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we don't believe that these issues modify the performance and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain confident in our existing recommendation.</p>
