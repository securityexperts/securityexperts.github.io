<p>The XT2's case is weatherproof, so you can stick it either indoors or outside, and features a convenient mounting bracket. While not tops, the 1080p video is records is good for the price, and best of all, it features complimentary cloud storage (up to 2 hours in total). Because Blink (and Ring) are owned by Amazon, the Blink app also has a connection to Ring's Neighbors app, where you can see a feed of other occurrences in your community, and post videos from your Blink camera. Blink's app is relatively robust, and while it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of Arlo's cameras, this sub-$ 100 has a lot of features for the cost.</p>

<p>A clever lock is normally part of a robust clever home security setup, but you do not have to invest in a full-blown system to utilize one.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
