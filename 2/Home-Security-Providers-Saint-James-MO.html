<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you spend for". According to a report released by the Urban Institute, police departments nationwide respond to countless false alarms from citizen and business security systems every year. This costs cities and towns countless dollars in wasted police resources. The Vivint Smart Home security system is trusted and simple to use, but expensive and eccentric unless you desire the benefit of a professional install and maintenance.</p>
<p>The biggest downside of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensing unit gets activated while you're away, you have no visual ways of validating if something is in fact incorrect and how severe the situation is. If the alarm occurrence is determined to be a false alarm, the city will mail an invoice summarizing the occurrence and examining a charge, if any.</p>
