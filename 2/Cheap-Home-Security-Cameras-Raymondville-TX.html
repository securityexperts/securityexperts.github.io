Although some companies provide complimentary or heavily reduced hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we discovered no-contract systems to be the most flexible. Some individuals may want to sign up for service only for when they or their partner is out of town, for instance. No-contract systems also cost less in the long run and permit you to be in total control of the equipment you utilize, as well as how and when you pay and utilize for monitoring services.</p>

All smart-home devices are susceptible to such events. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have chosen to pull our recommendation of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our clever video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it concerns video products, we do not believe that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our existing suggestion.</p>
