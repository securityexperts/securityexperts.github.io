We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky.
