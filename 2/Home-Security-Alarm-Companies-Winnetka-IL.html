<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search innovation that is rapidly altering the security industry, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Learning and why is it so essential?  For starters, Deep Learning allows someone to find what they are trying to find without having to explore hours of ineffective video footage.  Think of a webpage that works a lot like a Google search, where you can describe the elements you are trying to find in the tape-recorded video footage.  For example, if we need to see all video from today that has a police vehicle in it, we simply type cops" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective solution for catching criminals and collecting proof.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>

You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the individual being seen understand they're being watched, and you can select to tape video clips or photos and save them to your clever device on an impulse. </p>
