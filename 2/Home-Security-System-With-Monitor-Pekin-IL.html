<p>There's a few other cool functions in the camera itself such as an automated zoom which tracks moving objects if it detects an intruder; a handy intercom function that allows the device to act as a clever doorbell (although it does not have a chime or button - for that you'll need the Nest Hi doorbell ); and, given that Alphabet owns Nest, the camera brings Google Assistant.</p>
