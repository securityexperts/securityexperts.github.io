Logitech does make a cordless version of the Circle 2, though we do not advise it considering that its battery-saving regimens can disrupt performance.</p>

We initially noticed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it quickly ended up being a staff (and family and friends) fave.
