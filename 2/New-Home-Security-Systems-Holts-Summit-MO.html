Outdoor security cameras undoubtedly cost more than their indoor cousins, because-- for starters-- the need to be secured from the elements.

<p>Camera, or closed-circuit tv (CCTV), are becoming an increasingly more prevalent feature of American life. Worries of terrorism and the accessibility of ever-cheaper cameras have actually accelerated the trend even more.
