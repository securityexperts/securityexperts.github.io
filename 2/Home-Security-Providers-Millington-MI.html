<p>Maybe this is no much better demonstrated than through Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter's comments, at IFSEC International in 2019 Tony highlighted how much had actually changed considering that he handled the function in 2014, with the development of facial recognition, drones, body-worn cameras, analytics, GDPR and a lot more.

Porter for that reason noted that the Home Office and surveillance industry need to make sure only software and hardware compliant with pertinent standards, such as Secure by Default, is installed in public and personal areas alike.</p>
<p>It's not almost security from theft, either.
