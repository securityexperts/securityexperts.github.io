Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy option.

We also found the function to be more trustworthy on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a wider range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
