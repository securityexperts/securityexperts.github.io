<p>Yes, house owners can choose to self-monitor" their home security system.

Being able to distinguish between a car and a person, for example, allows you to minimize unnecessary alerts. And Activity Zones are a nice perk, especially if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, or even trash bin. </p>
