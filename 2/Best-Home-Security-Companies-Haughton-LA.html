<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally typical given that the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level.
