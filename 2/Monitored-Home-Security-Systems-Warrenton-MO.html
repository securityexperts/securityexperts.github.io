<h3>Security System House in Warrenton MO</h3>

Some systems save recorded video in your area on an SD card or a solid state drive, while others provide cloud storage.

Cloud storage makes it easy to shop and access recorded video, however it can cost numerous dollars per year depending upon your subscription. Some systems offer both cloud storage and local storage, and some provide a dedicated storage drive that provides you DVR abilities with time-lapse recording, that makes it easy to discover a video event that happened at a specific point in time.</p>
