<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of capturing video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras.
