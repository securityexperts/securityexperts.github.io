<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually plainly attempted to provide it an attractive edge, and we have to offer credit to its capability to reveal what's going on from approximately four cameras at a time. It can be awkward and slow to utilize on event - with the process of linking to the camera for a live view rather languid at times. The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest web cam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some money - it does have a cable attached though, instead of working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit much easier to screw up for possible burglars.
