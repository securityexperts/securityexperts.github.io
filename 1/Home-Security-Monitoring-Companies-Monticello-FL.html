<p>On the surface area, these 2 camera categories may appear comparable, though if you had the ability to see inside, the differences become obvious and distinct. Commercial-grade cameras are developed and constructed for high-performance applications where failure is not an alternative; consumer-grade cameras are not. Normally, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is a lot of readily available light, and when the lighting becomes low or missing (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree begins to show.
