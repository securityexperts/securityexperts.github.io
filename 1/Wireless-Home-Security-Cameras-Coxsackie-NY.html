<p>Often a wired system can be confused with local alarms. However, the 2 are drastically different. The main distinction is that the wired system couple with the other smart home devices to develop a network of home security around your home. It can be controlled from another location through voice commands and you have access to each part of the wired system from your mobile phone or through the control panel (also called the alarm panel).

Likewise a local alarm will not call the authorities; it simply sets off an audible siren to inform people nearby.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely typical given that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once clients recognize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
