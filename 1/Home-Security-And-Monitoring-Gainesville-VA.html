<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously impressive piece of innovation. For starters, it looks gorgeous: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily similar to the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you may call to mind when you think of a home security camera. The first wireless function to consider is the security system and its components, and how they all link. In the past, every monitoring element was hard-wired back to a panel box. This implied every door and window needed its own wire and path of holes through your house.</p>
<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak with an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a problem but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger an interruption in the signal.

Obviously, DVRs need analog cameras, while NVRs utilize IP cameras, however the compatibility concern extends well beyond that difference. Some NVR systems, for example, work with the IP cameras just from certain manufacturers and not others. When buying a video recorder, you must first make sure that the gadget will deal with the cameras you have actually bought. If you're dealing with a surveillance system integrator to configure your system, the cameras must have the ability to supply you with the essential information.</p>
