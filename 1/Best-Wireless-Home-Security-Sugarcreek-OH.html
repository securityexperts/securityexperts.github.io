<p>The Nest Web cam Outdoor's 1080p images and sound were remarkable in our testing-- throughout the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would periodically downgrade the photo quality based upon offered bandwidth, which might fluctuate throughout the day.

It turned out to be an incorrect alarm-- one she paid the local authorities $150 for.</p>
