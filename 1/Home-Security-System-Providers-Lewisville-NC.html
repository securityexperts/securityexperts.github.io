When you think of a home security camera, it's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you might call to mind. The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its parts, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring component was hard-wired back to a panel box.

<p>The Hive View provides terrific 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation activated too easily, even when on the lowest sensitivity setting.

We likewise experienced above-average connectivity problems, with 2 Hive test units disconnecting eight times over 2 months.</p>

<p>For these different systems to assemble or to integrate them together into a single interface, a comprehensive knowledge of all the needed systems is needed. There are just two options if there are no as-built documents supplying performance and configuration details to make this integration work. The very first option, which may be the most complicated, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original service provider is reluctant or not available to supply those information) and document the topology and how they can be included into the new DVS system. The other approach is to rip and replace, performing a total upgrade to a new security system that already has all the existing system requirements plus the ability to converge them all.</p>
<p>Many robbers enter your home or business when you aren't around. The come throughout the day, when you're likely to be at work or running errands.
