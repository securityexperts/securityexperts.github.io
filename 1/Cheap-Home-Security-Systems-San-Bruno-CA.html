<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of technology. For starters, it looks gorgeous: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you may recollect when you imagine a home security camera. The first wireless function to think about is the security system and its elements, and how they all connect. In the past, every monitoring element was hard-wired back to a panel box. This indicated every windows and door needed its own wire and path of holes through your house.</p>
<p>Sadly, nearly every wireless device can be a prospective target for hackers. Regretfully, security systems are no exception.

Many will have a backup battery system that turns on in case of a failure, however long term outages will lead to the system losing power. It's also crucial to consider how long you prepare to stay at the same residence when choosing a wired system. They are not portable and can't move with you since these security systems are incorporated into the home's circuitry.</p>

<p>The 2nd important thing to state is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill in-built alarm, so it functions as a home alarm as well as a security camera.
