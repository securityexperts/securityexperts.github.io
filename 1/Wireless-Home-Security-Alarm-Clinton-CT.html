<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it must be. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we often found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>The only part of the Vivint experience that isn't automated is installation-- that's left to the company's polite, well-informed professionals.
