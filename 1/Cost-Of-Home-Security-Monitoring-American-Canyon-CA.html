We initially noticed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera advised us of Disney's WALL-E But once we attempted it out, it quickly ended up being a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker. It can't send out alerts, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
