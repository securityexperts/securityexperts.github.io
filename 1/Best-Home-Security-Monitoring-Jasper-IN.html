<p>Just recently, Ring rejected reports that it had actually suffered an information breach, however we concur with its suggestion that users must reset passwords and make it possible for two-factor authentication as a precautionary measure. All smart-home devices are vulnerable to such incidents. However, after this newest entry in a year-long series of questionable media reports, we have actually chosen to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you plan to pair the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please first read the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While we believe Ring's defects are a dealbreaker when it comes to video products, we do not believe that these concerns change the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our existing suggestion.</p>
