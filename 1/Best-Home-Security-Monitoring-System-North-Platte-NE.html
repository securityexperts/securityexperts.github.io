<p>Ring might not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that reward), however it sure has gotten quite the fanfare over the years. We have actually been testing Ring Alarm quite a bit recently, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it?

Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you select the totally free self-monitor" option.</p>

<p>While you have to spend for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more affordable subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month.
