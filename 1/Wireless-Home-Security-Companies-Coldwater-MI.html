<p>Numerous other models were disqualified due to performance problems. We had issues with the app for the Honeywell Home C2, which was also pestered with fuzzy night vision and left spaces (5 seconds to 10 seconds) in between 30-second clips.

Incorrect home network configurations, defects in the devices or password compromise could allow a hacker to break into the system and figure out if anyone is home, and even seize control. Though keeping the huge amount of information can be an issue, it's not uncommon for IP CCTV systems to have software application that governs the length of time the video is saved, and at what quality. After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage area, for instance.</p>
