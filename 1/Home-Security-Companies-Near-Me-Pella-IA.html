As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, once customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically far too late given that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
