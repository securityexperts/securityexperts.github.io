The field of vision is a narrow 110 degrees (compared to 130 on Nest and Netgear and Logitech's 180). However, after almost two years of use, night and day images have always been clear, and we never ever had issues with the camera missing out on motion, an issue we came across when checking the Wyze Webcam Pan And for those times when you're left questioning why your camera sent out a motion alert, Wyze has a clever feature you can toggle on or off called Motion Tagging It produces a green, on-screen box around the motion found.
