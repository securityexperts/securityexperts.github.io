That's why a standard installation can use up to 4 hours. Wide Dynamic Cameras have the ability to stabilize light-levels on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The picture is sharp and clear and I saw really little lag between my actions and the image showed on the app. I 'd definitely say it's one of the better cameras in regards to video quality.</p>
<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras are able to shoot in what is referred to as "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike people, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
