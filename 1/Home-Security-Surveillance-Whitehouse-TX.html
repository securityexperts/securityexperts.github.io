When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.

When a patient presses the emergency button, it sends out double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS.
