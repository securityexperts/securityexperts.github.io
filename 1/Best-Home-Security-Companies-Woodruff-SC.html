<p>The Nest Camera Indoor is the third generation of the popular Dropcam-- one of the first, and one of the very best home security cameras-- and bumps up its predecessors' video quality to 1080p. It's simple to set up and, thanks to its magnetic, rotating base, it can be set up practically anywhere inside. The video looks sharp; night vision is clear; the camera can be used as an intercom; and it engages with the Nest Thermostat and the Nest Protect smoke detector, as well as many third-party clever- home devices. But to actually use the camera's functions, you'll have to spend $10 or more each month for the Nest Aware program, which offers you access to cloud storage, person detection and customizable activity zones.</p>
