Part of that is due to the fact that ADT has more customers than many brand names-- which suggests it has more opportunities to run into problems. However part of it is the way ADT sells its equipment. When a company deals with several dealerships and suppliers, its consumers are going to get a broad range of experiences. Some will be good, and some will be bad.</p>
<p>A system that needs a contract might be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Since contract-based security systems usually don't included upfront costs. Rather, the costs are spread out over the length of the agreement. We've seen 1-year, all the method up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term agreement (and who does?). Our pick: No agreement.</p>

Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
