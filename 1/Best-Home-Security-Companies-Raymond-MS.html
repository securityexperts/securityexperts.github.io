<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Possession protection devices are created to safeguard specific, concrete properties, such as jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and household heirlooms.

<p>Cameras often transmit footage over the Internet, enabling operators to monitor security camera feeds from another location.
