<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. Standard parts in a lot of home security packages include a master control panel, the control keypad, sensor pads for windows and doors and a motion sensing unit gadget. Some systems are linked to an offsite alarm monitoring service, while others have at home alarms. Obviously you can buy more equipment like surveillance cameras, glass break sensing units, CO detectors and smoke detector.</p>
<p>The other major choice when picking a home security camera is whether you need an indoor or outdoor  camera. Outdoor cameras will typically be built to be more long lasting and able to survive rain, frost, or damp.

That's still significant, however it's a lot less than the typical loss of a break-in. While the rate of thefts nationally has actually reduced, the typical loss has increased-- in 2018, that number was close to $3,0002 (more on that in the robbery data area above).</p>
<p>When purchasing a system online, know that most of the time professional alarm companies will not install consumer bought items! Why?
