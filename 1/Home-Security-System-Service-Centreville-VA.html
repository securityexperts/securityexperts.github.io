<p>Something that needs to be thought about when installing CCTV cameras is how they will be powered, and how wiring will be run throughout the structure. In a lot of cases, you'll be able to install cameras and electrical wiring merely by running the wires through a drop tile ceiling and into the wall. Other tasks will demand the use of channel - piping for running the wiring and securing it - and sometimes, removing part of the wall to lay circuitry inside.
