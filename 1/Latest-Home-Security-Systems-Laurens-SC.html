With no drilling or elaborate electrical wiring to be done, wireless systems typically don't need professional installation, and since they do not need a extensive and labor-intensive  removal of wires, they can be moved fairly quickly, a certain benefit for renters and individuals on the go.

<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by an expert home security company.
