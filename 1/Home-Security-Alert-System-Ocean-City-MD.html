<p>MAC filtering is effective just for small residential (SOHO) networks, because it provides protection only when the wireless gadget is "off the air".

Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can obtain the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers only an incorrect sense of security given that it prevents just "casual" or unexpected connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
