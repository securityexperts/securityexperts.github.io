<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that talk to an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera close to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a problem however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disturbance in the signal. A wireless bridge is a terrific choice for long range scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light.
