<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely regular considering that the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as customers realize that the low-cost customer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's typically too late given that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
