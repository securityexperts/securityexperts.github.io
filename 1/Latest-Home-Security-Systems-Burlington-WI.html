All smart-home gadgets are susceptible to such incidents. Nevertheless, after this newest entry in a year-long series of controversial media reports, we have decided to pull our suggestion of Ring's video doorbells. If you prepare to combine the Ring Alarm with any of Ring's video doorbells or cameras, please initially check out the What about Ring? area from our wise video doorbell guide. While our company believe Ring's flaws are a dealbreaker when it comes to video items, we do not believe that these problems modify the functionality and user experience of the Ring Alarm, so we remain positive in our existing recommendation.</p>
