<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has actually plainly tried to offer it an attractive edge, and we need to give credit to its ability to show what's going on from as much as 4 cameras at a time. It can be slow and uncomfortable to utilize on occasion - with the procedure of connecting to the camera for a live view rather languid sometimes. The previous, more affordable version of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you want to conserve some cash - it does have actually a cable television attached however, rather than working wirelessly, which indicates it's a bit easier to undermine for possible trespassers.
