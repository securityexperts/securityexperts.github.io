<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<p>While you have to pay for cloud video storage on the Arlo Pro 3, it's one of the more cost effective subscriptions out there at $2.99 a month.
