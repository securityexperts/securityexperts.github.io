<p>Cameras often transmit video over the Internet, permitting operators to monitor security camera feeds from another location.

A good home security camera should also have a scheduling function, so that you can turn it off while you're home, and on when you leave.</p>

<p>An NVR makes it simple to record video surveillance video, however you will require linked disk drives on which to save this video footage.
