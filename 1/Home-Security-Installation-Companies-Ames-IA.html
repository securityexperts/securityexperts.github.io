<p>It works with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate inside or indoors - you get a lot of flexibility from this little device. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of view, the motion detection, and the removable magnetic base which is easy to install.

<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is necessary.

Without it, you will not get the person-detection function, adjustable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Being able to compare a person and an automobile, for instance, allows you to cut down on unnecessary signals. And Activity Zones are a great perk, particularly if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the backyard, an entrance, or even trash bin. </p>
