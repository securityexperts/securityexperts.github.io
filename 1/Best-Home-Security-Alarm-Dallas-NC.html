<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. If recording video in the dark is a priority, make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs.</p>

In a declaration to SafeWise, Ring kept in mind that these breaches can be avoided by using strong, distinct passwords, making it possible for two-factor authentication, changing passwords frequently, and including licensed users rather of sharing credentials. </p>
