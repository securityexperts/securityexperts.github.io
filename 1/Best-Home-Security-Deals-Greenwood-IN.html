<p>Bullet cameras are among the 2 most common CCTV camera types. They have a long cylindrical shape, providing their name and a distinct look. This look is identifiable to nearly everyone and therefore serves as a deterrent to undesirable people. If security cameras are visible, the hope is lawbreakers and burglars go somewhere else rather. That being stated, bullet cameras are more vulnerable to vandalism due to the fact that of their apparent look. In addition, the shape of the camera is ideal for focusing on a fixed field, such as an entry or exit, but needs numerous cameras if a user needs to see multiple set views. Bullet cameras are easily mountable and can work indoors or outdoors. They feature a small lip on completion of the camera that adds weather condition protection and minimizes glare.</p>
