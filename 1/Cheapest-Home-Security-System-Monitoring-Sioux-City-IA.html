<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with someone from the monitoring company when an alarm is activated.

<h3>Security System Equipment in Sioux City IA</h3>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky.
