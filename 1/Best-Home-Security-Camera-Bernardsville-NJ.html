<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to record clear video in dark conditions. These cameras count on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light.

The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a top priority.</p>
