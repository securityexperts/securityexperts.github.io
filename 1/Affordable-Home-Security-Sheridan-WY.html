<p>MAC filtering works just for small residential (SOHO) networks, considering that it supplies protection just when the wireless gadget is "off the air". Any 802.11 device "on the air" freely transfers its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it requires no special equipment or software application to spot it. Anyone with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies only a false sense of security given that it prevents only "casual" or unintended connections to the organizational facilities and not does anything to prevent a directed attack.</p>
