<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
