<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras.
