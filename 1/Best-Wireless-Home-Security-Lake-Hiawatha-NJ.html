<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely normal because the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
