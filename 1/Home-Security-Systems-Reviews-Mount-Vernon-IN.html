<p>We have all heard that old stating, you get what you spend for". This design from Samsung Wisenet will fit the expense if you're looking for a robust DVR system that feels premium and records in 2K quality. It ships with four streamlined and white bullet-style cameras developed for indoor and outdoor usage. They're equipped with night vision tech that utilizes infrared LEDs and wise IR to provide up to130ft (or 40m) night vision range. Like others on our list, the DVR system works with a mobile app that lets you see what the cameras are seeing in real-time, though we found in our testing that the app periodically forgot cameras which then needed to be re-added.</p>
<p>Lastly, I check out a home security system's app, making certain it's highly sound and easy to use, particularly if there is home automation involved. I also check app reviews from the Apple and the Google Play shops, trying to find home security apps with rankings of a minimum of three stars or above.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not terrific but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have horrible night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far too many motion sets off.</p>
