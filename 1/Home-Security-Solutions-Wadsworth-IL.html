<p>A taut wire border security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually installed on a fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to find any physical effort to permeate the barrier. Tight wire systems can operate with a range of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms brought on by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect items that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to trespassers digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight below the fence is set up to prevent this kind of attack.</p>

It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it reduces false alarms, and it can even identify people you've identified (after a knowing duration). However like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live viewing.</p>
