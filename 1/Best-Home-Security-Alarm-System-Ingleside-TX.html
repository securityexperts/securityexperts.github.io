<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can determine people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it spots a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We likewise found the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
