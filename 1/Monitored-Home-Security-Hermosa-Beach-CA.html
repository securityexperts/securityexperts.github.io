<p>There is a new pattern in surveillance video search technology that is rapidly altering the security market, and it is called Deep Knowing". What is Deep Learning and why is it so important?  For starters, Deep Knowing permits someone to find what they are searching for without having to search through hours of ineffective video footage.  Imagine a website that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the elements you are searching for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we require to see all video from today that has a police vehicle in it, we merely type police" into the search window and in seconds every key frame of video with a patrol car appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective option for capturing wrongdoers and gathering evidence.</p>

After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage area, for example.</p>

It also implies that if you in fact saw a burglar riffle through your home, you might rapidly record a message to him or her through your mobile phone, and the Nest would play it aloud. Which, you envision, would be enough to send even the most dedicated profession criminal scampering empty-handed down the roadway. </p>
