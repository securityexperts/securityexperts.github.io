However I also appreciate minimalist systems that components that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some elements can make home automation readily available to you. Whatever the elements are (camera, motion sensor, window sensor, smart lock, etc.), I want to make certain that they all quickly communicate with your app that is always at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
