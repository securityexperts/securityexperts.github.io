<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service includes a benefit called ASAPer, which at the same time messages a group of pre-set contacts to figure out whether alarm activity is a real emergency or incorrect alarm. A lot of monitoring center call household members one at a time, which can slow response times.</p>
<p>The greatest drawback of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets triggered while you're away, you have no visual ways of validating if something is actually incorrect and how severe the scenario is.

<p>ASecureLife's recommendation: Go to Call for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small charge.

<p>The huge reward is the 90dB alarm squeezed into a device that does not appear like a home security system. You can set the alarm off or contact emergency situation services direct from the app if you see a disruption, and it rarely sends false signals since it tracks your phone (and other relative's phones), so comprehends when you're at home and turns everything off. Likewise, it will equip itself instantly when everybody has actually left.</p>
