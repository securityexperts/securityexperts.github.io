The first home alarm system was patented in 1853 by a Bostonian innovator called Augustus Russell Pope.</p>
<p>Some wireless home security systems offer a video recording storage choice and others do not. For the ones that don't, you have the ability to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; however, nothing is tape-recorded.
