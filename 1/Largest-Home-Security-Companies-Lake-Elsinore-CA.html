<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times most likely to be robbed. Brinks owns and runs its own US-based monitoring center. Its monitoring service consists of an advantage called ASAPer, which at the same time messages a group of pre-set contacts to figure out whether alarm activity is a real emergency or false alarm.

Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the cost and it doesn't consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>
