If services like file shares, access to printers etc. are available on the local net, it is recommended to have authentication (i.e. by password) for accessing it (one must never ever assume that the private network is not accessible from the outside). Correctly set up, it must be safe to enable access to the local network to outsiders.</p>

<p>Had ADT, technically still have.  If you want to get out of the contract you need to pay 75% of the agreement.

I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales people do not need to discuss it, it's on you to check out the small print. I'm paying the swelling sum, due to the fact that apparently they car restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send out in a written not by mail.  ADT is a nightmare, method too pricey, and not terrific.</p>

Cameras are quite standard for self monitored alarm systems, particularly due to the fact that incorrect alarms is an extremely real possibility.</p>
