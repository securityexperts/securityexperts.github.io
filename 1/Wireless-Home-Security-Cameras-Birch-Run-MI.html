We also like that the Kasa Web cam Outdoor won't break the bank (it costs $88.16 at the time of composing), and it's extremely simple to install. Purchasing multiple Arlo Pro 2's can get expensive.

<p>Lighting: Many security cameras are able to shoot in what is called "low-light infrared," enabling them to catch clear footage in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark location in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video footage in a lit up space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if capturing footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>Equipment includes things like your door and window sensing units, motion sensors, control board, etc. The cost completely depends upon which provider you select, but expect to pay a couple of hundred dollars for a basic package--$ 200 would be considered cheap for a starter pack of home security equipment. That stated, it can run less expensive if you opt for a company that runs a great deal of deals on equipment (like Frontpoint). </p>
