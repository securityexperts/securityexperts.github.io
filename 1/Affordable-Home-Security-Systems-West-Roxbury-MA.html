<p>Remember that Nest cameras aren't professionally monitored-- that part's on you. (The remainder of the equipment is monitored by Brinks Home Security.) However because the majority of retail theft would not journey an alarm anyhow (a staff member slipping some extra money while offering a client modification, for example), we believe it's more important to have top quality images so you have the proof you require. And that's what Nest offers you.</p>
<p>IP (Internet protocol) cameras perform the same functions as their analog equivalents, but with vastly higher capabilities. IP cameras boast sharper, higher resolution images and more versatile functions like remote zoom and repositioning. They also give you the choice to view video on a web internet browser. This makes it possible to get notices regarding anything strange your cameras records-- such as motion inside your business at 3:00 am-- and view it live from anywhere by means of a computer or smart device. The major downside of IP cameras is their higher cost.</p>
