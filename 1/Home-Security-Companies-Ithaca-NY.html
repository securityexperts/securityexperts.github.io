<p>The very best part about having a hybrid system is that it's highly customizable, so you can build the ideal security system for your distinct living situation.

Many insurer offer discount rates on insurance coverage premiums to customers with operable alarm systems. These discounts may be as much as 20 percent for commercial clients, and slightly less for residential owners. 16 In addition, many police departments offer several "complimentary" false alarms prior to imposing any fine, even though the cost to react is considerable right from the start. The offers of complimentary monitoring services by alarm companies and discounts from insurance companies cast doubt on the appropriateness of the current trend in U.S. policing of allowing three or 4 totally free false alarms per fiscal year, because they offer no up-front rewards to encourage owners to avoid incorrect alarms.</p>
