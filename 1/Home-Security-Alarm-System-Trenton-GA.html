<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were outstanding in our screening-- throughout the day and during the night-- with a wide, 130-degree field of view and 8 x digital zoom that enabled us to get a closer view in live video. We need to note that the camera would sometimes downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which might change throughout the day.
