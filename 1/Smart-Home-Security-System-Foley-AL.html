<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational data to a harmful aggressor, considering that the disruption of the network prevents the flow of data and in fact indirectly secures data by preventing it from being transmitted. The usual factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, throughout which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the destructive enemy to tape these codes and use various breaking tools to examine security weak points and exploit them to acquire unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can release a dictionary style attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security essential recorded during the network recovery.</p>
