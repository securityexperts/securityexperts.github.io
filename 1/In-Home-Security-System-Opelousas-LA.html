<h3>Security System In Home Opelousas LA 70570</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's easy to check in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We first observed Wyze due to the fact that its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E But once we tried it out, it rapidly ended up being a personnel (and friends and family) favorite. I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send signals, you can't control it remotely, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
