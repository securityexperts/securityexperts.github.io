<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids speaking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is triggered. Let's face it, incorrect alarms are fairly common. If a homeowner forgets their secrets and goes back inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a community feline, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the homeowner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the property owner disables it quickly. False alarms take place. With a self-monitored system, a house owner will not receive calls from a monitoring company. Instead, homeowners access the alarm themselves and take the needed action.</p>

Strategies included searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV evaluation study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV assessments, and calling leading researchers to inquire about upcoming examinations. Both published and unpublished reports were included in the search, which was not limited to the English language and was international in scope.</p>
