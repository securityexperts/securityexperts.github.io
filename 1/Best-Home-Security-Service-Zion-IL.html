<p>With cutting edge burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced functions, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
