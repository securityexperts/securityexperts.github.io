We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and just alerts you when motion is created by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (guaranteeing there's no false alerts). Nevertheless, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 per month) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have been activated.
