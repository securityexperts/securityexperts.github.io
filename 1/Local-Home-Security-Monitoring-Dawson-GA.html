<p>No calls from a monitoring company: A self-monitored system avoids talking with somebody from the monitoring company when an alarm is set off. Let's face it, false alarms are fairly typical. If a property owner forgets their keys and returns inside with the alarm engaged, or an outdoor motion sensing unit is triggered by a neighborhood cat, it can trigger the alarm. With a professionally monitored system, the house owner will be called by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the homeowner disables it rapidly. False alarms occur.
