With a professionally monitored system, the property owner will be gotten in touch with by the monitoring company each time the alarm goes off, unless the house owner disables it rapidly. False alarms happen. With a self-monitored system, a house owner won't receive calls from a monitoring company. Rather, house owners access the alarm themselves and take the essential action.</p>

If there are no as-built files providing functionality and configuration details to make this combination work, there are only 2 options. The very first alternative, which may be the most intricate, is to reverse-engineer each system (if the original option provider is unavailable or unwilling to supply those information) and document the topology and how they can be incorporated into the new DVS system.
