<p>Your CCTV camera may make you feel physically more secure, however after reading this short article, it will sure make you feel practically susceptible. On the simpler side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of wise home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't add a ton of other smart home tech to the system. It will not work with loads of smart home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely excellent, and while the level of control does not match SmartThings, producing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or turning up the heat when you journey the motion sensing unit in the morning - are refreshingly simple.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, there's a substantial difference in between the latest clever home cameras and a burglar-proof CCTV security network, but the beauty of the latest clever products, and their accompanying control apps, is you can expand the system as you require (or can pay for) in addition to incorporate whatever to deal with other wise gadgets such as the lighting and heating, helping to create an all-inclusive clever home, not simply a burglar alarm.</p>
