<p>Throughout the spring and summer season, home security or alarm companies employ taking a trip sales representatives to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "sales calls" on homeowners. In some cases, the salespeople use misleading or high-pressure sales techniques to get potential consumers to buy expensive, and often substandard, systems or equipment they don't need.</p>
<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be expensive however is important. In reality, we do not recommend buying this camera at all unless you plan to add the membership.
