But suicide opponents are clearly not deterred by video cameras - and might even be brought in to the television protection cameras can ensure - and the cost of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up around 20 percent of that nation's criminal justice spending plan - far surpasses the restricted benefits that the system may provide in examining attacks or tried attacks after the fact (see fact sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
