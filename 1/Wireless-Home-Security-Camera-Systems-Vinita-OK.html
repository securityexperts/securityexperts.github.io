Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing out on, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>

Due to the fact that animal safe" motion sensors can still false alarm if your pet dog or cat delves into the secured area or puts on some weight.
