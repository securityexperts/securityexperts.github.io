<p>Xfinity Home Refund Policy for Pre-Payments: If you make a pre-payment prior to installation of your Xfinity Home service, such pre-payment will be used as a credit to charges due on the following month's bill from Comcast. In case you cancel your Xfinity Home service, your pre-payment will be used instead to any other charges due on your costs for Comcast services. You will not get a cash or charge card refund of your pre-payment. However, if all of your services from Comcast are detached, or if Comcast is otherwise needed under appropriate law to refund the pre-payment, Comcast will, within forty-five (45) days or as otherwise defined by relevant law, return a sum equivalent to the pre-payments your made (without interest unless otherwise needed by law) minus any amounts due on your account (including, without restriction, any amounts owed for any services or for any equipment that is damaged, modified or not returned).</p>
