<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we've checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which automatically zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even determine individuals you have actually labeled (after a learning duration).
