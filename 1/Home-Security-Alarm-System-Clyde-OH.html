With many Do It Yourself systems, such as the SimpliSafe Home Security Kit, the Ring Alarm Security Package, and the Nest Secure, you purchase the hardware outright and can avoid any monthly fees if you decide to self-monitor. If you include monitoring, costs will vary: SimpliSafe charges $14.99 monthly for its no-contract monitoring service, while Nest charges $29 each month.
