The creative bit is that the camera not only finds that people have entered its 130-degree visual field, however it will also have a stab at acknowledging them too. Perhaps more usefully, if someone passes who the camera doesn't know, you get an alert about an "unknown face". You can tell the system who it is (if it's not an intruder), and next time around it should automatically know.</p>
