<h3>Home Window Security Whiteville NC 28472</h3>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, works on 2 AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of complimentary cloud storage, and it catches a much better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, mobile phone notices and live views were painfully slow, and the variety is poor. Also, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, don't anticipate to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
