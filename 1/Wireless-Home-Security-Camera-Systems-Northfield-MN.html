This generally involves discovering an area for your camera, producing an account in the app, and connecting the camera to your Wi-Fi network.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the severe environment.</p>
