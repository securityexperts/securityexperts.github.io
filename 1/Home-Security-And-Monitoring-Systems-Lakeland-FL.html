<p>With cutting edge alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cable that restricts placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not decide to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that compare people and general motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
<p>The biggest disadvantage of SmartThings is that there's no camera. As such, if an alarm or sensor gets activated while you're away, you have no visual means of verifying if something is really wrong and how major the scenario is. If the alarm occurrence is figured out to be an incorrect alarm, the city will send by mail a billing summarizing the event and examining a charge, if any.</p>
