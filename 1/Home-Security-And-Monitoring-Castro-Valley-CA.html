<p>This cool clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we found it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren rapidly triggering when movement was spotted. We like that it likewise lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For a lot of homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be installed on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
