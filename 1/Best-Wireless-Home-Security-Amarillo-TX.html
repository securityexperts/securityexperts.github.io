Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will trigger.</p>
