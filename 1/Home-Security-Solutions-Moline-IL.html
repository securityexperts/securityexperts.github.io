While IP cameras are typically more pricey than their analog counterparts, the overall cost of a full IP system tends to be slightly lower than that of a similar analog system. Considering that IP cameras have a wider visual field, also, an IP system can often work with fewer less cameras than an analog system.</p>
<p>A system that requires a contract might be a wise choice for those who are cash-strapped or do not wish to pay for the equipment up-front. Why? Because contract-based security systems generally do not come with in advance charges. Rather, the costs are expanded over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>

<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring plans, and features are nearly identical to those of the Brinks system. Nevertheless, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more expensive for the very same level of service, its contracts are longer, its cancellation fees are difficult, and its rates is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyhow.</p>
