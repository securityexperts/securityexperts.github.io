We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll require to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare individuals and basic motion.
