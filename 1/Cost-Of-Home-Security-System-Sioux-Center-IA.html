<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
