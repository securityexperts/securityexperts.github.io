These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and then combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical since the entrance and room appear to be at the same brightness level.
