When a client pushes the emergency button, it sends out double notifies: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Furthermore, if the main patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, indicating that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would evaluate the danger and, if required, could just press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
