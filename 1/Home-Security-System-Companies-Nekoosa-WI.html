<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the entrance and room seem at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everybody going into the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, as soon as consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
