<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, once customers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's generally far too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>

Being able to distinguish between an automobile and an individual, for example, enables you to reduce unneeded notifies. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're looking to monitor a specific corner of the backyard, a doorway, or perhaps garbage cans. </p>
