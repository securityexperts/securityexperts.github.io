<p>We installed our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we could point them at the exact same area and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting components, which I had actually installed on the patio by a licensed electrician (who takes place to be my hubby). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router inside your home (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>Our experience with expert installation was mixed. Our tester stated the service technician offered strong client service: He dropped a few unnecessary window sensors from my costs after deciding that the motion detector was sufficient for the whole front half of my home." However, there were some concerns with linking the command hub to our tester's network. </p>
