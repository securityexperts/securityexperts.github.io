We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced functions, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We believe that's costly.</p>
