On the easier side, with SimpliSafe, you trade the bells and whistles of smart home equipment for flexibility and low prices. SimpliSafe does have a video doorbell with two-way audio, but you can't include a lots of other wise home tech to the system. It will not work with loads of clever home equipment from other companies. The app is hugely excellent, and while the level of control doesn't match SmartThings, developing 'Actions' - such as turning the hall light on when you open the front door, or showing up the heat when you trip the motion sensing unit in the morning - are refreshingly easy.</p>

<p>If you use Alexa to control the clever lights in your home, then you need to think about checking out Alexa Guard, a fairly new home security mode with a couple of cool techniques.

Wireless security systems are more nimble and integratable, but low signal strength and bad connectivity are still common complaints.

In spite of a basic improvement in wireless technology, there seem less methods for hardwired systems to be interfered with and crippled. </p>
