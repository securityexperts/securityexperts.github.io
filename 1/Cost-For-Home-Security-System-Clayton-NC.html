<p>Absolutely nothing is more vital than safeguarding what you treasure most ... your family and home. You don't have to buy a multi-million dollar surveillance system to keep an eye on your property and ownerships. On the occasion that your alarm is triggered, your home security system sends out a wireless alert to the monitoring company where security experts are waiting to respond by instantly contacting you and if need be, the regional medical, fire or police authorities.</p>
<p>Brinks Home Security systems utilize a passcode, the Brinks Home Security app, Bluetooth hands-free disarming and an optional keychain remote. Some assaults and burglaries happen at night.
