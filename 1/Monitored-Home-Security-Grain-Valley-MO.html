<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range".

As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras.
