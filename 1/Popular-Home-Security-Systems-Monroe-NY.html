When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which means. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which indicates when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
