<p>We have actually long been fans of the Netatmo Welcome camera (₤ 199), with its understated appearances and face recognition software. The latter allows you to see exactly when a particular person reaches the house - so you'll when the kids got home from school and if they were alone, and whether the cleaner showed up on time. However Netatmo has actually broadened its security range with a brilliant outdoor camera and security light, the Existence (₤ 249.99), and a three pack of weatherproof window and door sensing units known as Tags (₤ 89.99). They also prepare to release a wise smoke detector and siren later this year, that makes this an even better proposition.</p>
