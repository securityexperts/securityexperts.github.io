<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside your home so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had set up on the patio by a licensed electrical contractor (who occurs to be my husband). All of the cameras were linked to the very same 2.4 GHz network by means of a Wi-Fi router indoors (around 40 feet from the cameras); service to your house was Verizon Fios.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered the camera controls, I was reasonably amazed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious. You've got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the individual being viewed understand they're being enjoyed, and you can pick to record video or pictures and save them to your smart gadget on an impulse. </p>
