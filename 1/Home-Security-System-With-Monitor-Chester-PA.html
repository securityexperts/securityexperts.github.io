<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my corridor. The security program I utilize is "blue iris" which was able to discover the camera without difficulty. The IR lights in the evening are able to toss light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not nearly as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, but it was half the rate and it does not eat up my wifi bandwidth.</p>
<p>IP security cameras catch analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection.

Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and inconsistent gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
