<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and then follows it around the field of view.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it cuts down on incorrect alarms, and it can even identify individuals you've labeled (after a learning period).
