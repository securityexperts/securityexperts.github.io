<p>The Canary Flex features a smart variation that sends informs directly to your phone if you're looking for motion detection. This camera provides a wide array of functions consisting of a 360-degree rotating base. Last time I examined a Swann camera I described it as decidedly middle of the roadway.

This newer version is much the same, to be frank.</p>
