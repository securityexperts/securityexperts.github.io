Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that notice movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be an easy mechanical contact, fixed force transducer or an electronic pressure gauge. Undesirable alarms triggered by birds and other animals can be avoided by changing the sensors to neglect objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires.
