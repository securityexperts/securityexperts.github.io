This look is recognizable to almost everyone and hence functions as a deterrent to unwanted people. If security cameras are visible, the hope is wrongdoers and intruders go in other places instead. That being said, bullet cameras are more susceptible to vandalism due to the fact that of their apparent look. In addition, the shape of the camera is perfect for concentrating on a set field, such as an entry or exit, but requires several cameras if a user needs to see multiple fixed views. Bullet cameras are quickly mountable and can work indoors or outdoors. They include a small lip on completion of the camera that adds weather protection and decreases glare.</p>
