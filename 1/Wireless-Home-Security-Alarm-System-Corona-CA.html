<p>Wireless systems allow for a drill-free installation. There are no wires to hide and normally no tools needed to get going. Out of our top choices of wireless home security companies, three offer DIY installation. Professional installation does provide hands-on aid from a trained technician, however most wireless systems are intuitive enough that no unique guidance is needed.

<p>Based on our evaluation, however, there are several downsides to picking Frontpoint Security.
