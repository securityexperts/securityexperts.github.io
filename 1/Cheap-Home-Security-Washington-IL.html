<p>One important exception: ADT has a landline monitoring strategy that's $36.99 monthly, which could be a budget-friendly choice for clients in backwoods. We advise cellular systems due to the fact that they're far more secure than landline systems, however there are some locations where cellular monitoring isn't readily available.
