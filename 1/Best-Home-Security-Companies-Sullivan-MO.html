<p>A tight wire boundary security system is essentially an independent screen of tensioned tripwires generally installed on a fence or wall. Additionally, the screen can be made so thick that there is no requirement for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to discover any physical attempt to permeate the barrier. Taut wire systems can run with a variety of switches or detectors that pick up motion at each end of the tense wires. These detectors or switches can be an easy mechanical contact, static force transducer or an electronic stress gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be prevented by changing the sensing units to overlook things that apply small amounts of pressure on the wires. This kind of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing straight listed below the fence is installed to avoid this kind of attack.</p>

<p>Are privately owned, operated surveillance cameras to be treated the same method as public cameras? We also require to draw fine lines about 'Who actually is seeing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyhow'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, no one! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom could refrain from doing. They might peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If an individual was standing enjoying outside a window it might be a crime, yet the very same individual might place a surveillance camera then remotely view a person within the privacy of their home. Most significantly, it is not against the chastening code.</p>
