<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we've tested. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic variety), and 12 x digital zoom.
