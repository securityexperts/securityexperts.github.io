<p>Our alarm systems might be armed in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the alarm system are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to acknowledge a violation. Once a zone has been breached, the intruder alarm system then dials an ADT monitoring center and transfers the message through a telephone line. When the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Entering the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>

I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is absolutely nothing more than a sound maker.
