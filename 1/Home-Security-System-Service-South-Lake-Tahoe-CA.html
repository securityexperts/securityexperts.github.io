<p>The Hive View provides excellent 1080p images day and night, but the motion activation set off too easily, even when on the lowest level of sensitivity setting.

<p>The San Diego Police Department intended to gain access to video from public and private cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego" surveillance program Since 2014, the program was riddled with software compatibility problems, and officers had problem seeing video in real time because the department's patrol car did not have a 4G connection.

<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can identify people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send out mobile phone notifies with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to want to differentiate anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
