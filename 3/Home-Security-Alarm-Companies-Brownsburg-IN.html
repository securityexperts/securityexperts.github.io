<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can transfer the large quantity of data needed by digital video and high resolutions at really fast speeds, and frequently over long distances. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are reliable, but not suitable with IP cameras.
