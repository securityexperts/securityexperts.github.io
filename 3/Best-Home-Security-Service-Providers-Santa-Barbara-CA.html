The more megapixels a camera sensing unit has, the more you can digitally focus and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>

<h3>Residential Security Systems Santa Barbara CA 93101</h3>
<p>With clear, HD video - day or night - it's simple to sign in on the kids; 2- and four-legged alike. We initially saw Wyze because its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a staff (and friends and family) favorite. I do not recommend SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a sound maker. It can't send alerts, you can't control it from another location, and you will not have access to their home security camera.</p>
