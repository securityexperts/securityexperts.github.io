We also found the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
