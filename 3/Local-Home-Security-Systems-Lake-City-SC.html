<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak with an existing network should be within 300 feet for optimum efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is absolutely something to be considered. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on second story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.

<p>The 2nd crucial thing to say is that the Arlo Pro 2 has a remarkably shrill inbuilt alarm, so it works as a home alarm system as well as a security camera.

It works either connected to power or with its built-in battery-- and it's the only Canary camera that you can utilize within and outdoors.</p>
