<p>With modern alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We discovered the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Camera for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not choose to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe membership to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between people and general motion. We think that's expensive.</p>
