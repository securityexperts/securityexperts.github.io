<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system identifies a break-in, fire, or other emergency situation, it alerts the security group and, in many cases, emergency situation responders. Sadly, history has actually revealed that surveillance innovations put in location for one purpose inevitably broaden into other uses.
