<p>A self-monitored system needs to be clever. It must have the capability to follow rules with cause-and-effect relationships between different gadgets.

Or you can produce another rule that states if the front door is open, your security camera must automatically begin tape-recording footage. In doing so, it can possibly safeguard your home from flooding, fire, or perhaps rapidly altering temperatures.</p>
