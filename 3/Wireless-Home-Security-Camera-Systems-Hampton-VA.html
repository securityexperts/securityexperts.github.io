<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a destructive opponent, considering that the disturbance of the network prevents the flow of information and actually indirectly protects information by avoiding it from being sent. The usual factor for performing a DoS attack is to observe the healing of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all gadgets, offering an opportunity for the harmful enemy to tape-record these codes and use different splitting tools to evaluate security weak points and exploit them to gain unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools readily available which can release a dictionary style attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based on the "design" security key caught during the network healing.</p>
