<p>Our SSA security system was installed at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales consultant. He supplied the recommendations concerning what was needed for our home and was on-site for the installation. Darek dealt with the installation and arrived right on time. He talked to us concerning placement of a few of the monitoring gadgets in our home. He also helped me in packing the app and completing the online set-up procedure. He also evaluated the new keypad performance. Both Darek and Ron were very professional and valuable. Thanks.</p>
<p>The very first thing I look at in a security system are its system elements. Home security industry is trying to offer new devices and technology is evolving. Now, many security systems include a multitude of parts, such as a base station, security camera, entry, motion, and glass break sensors, a keypad, and crucial fobs, among other components. But I likewise appreciate minimalist systems that components that carry out more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation readily available to you. Whatever the parts are (camera, motion sensing unit, window sensor, wise lock, and so on), I want to make certain that they all quickly communicate with your app that is constantly at hand, so you can watch on them from afar.</p>
<p>Usually, a basic installation will cost as much as $2 per square foot of your residential or commercial property. Monitoring charges are in between $25 and $40 per month, with around $10 additional for intercom communication. For pet-friendly devices, an additional $50 to $300 may require needed, while fire protection functions tend to be $5 extra a month. For a push-button control, you'll most likely need to pay a one-off charge of approximately $100. Costs shouldn't be charged to link you with the central monitoring station - this should be included as requirement.</p>

It works with Amazon Alexa, and it uses its own smart door lock, but you can't go installing lots of third-party devices with your SimpliSafe system. It doesn't deal with Z-Wave or IFTTT, and we don't expect it to add extra functionality anytime quickly.</p>
