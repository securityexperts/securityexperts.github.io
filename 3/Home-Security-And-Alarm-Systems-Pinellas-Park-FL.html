<p>The San Diego Police Department intended to gain access to video footage from personal and public cameras in real time as part of the Operation Secure San Diego" surveillance program Since 2014, the program was filled with software application compatibility problems, and officers had problem viewing footage in genuine time because the department's patrol car did not have a 4G connection.
