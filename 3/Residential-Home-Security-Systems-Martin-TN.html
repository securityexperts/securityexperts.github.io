<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone informs with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to differentiate predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also found the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also offer a broader range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
