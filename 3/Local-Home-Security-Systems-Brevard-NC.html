<p>Video surveillance monitoring is as old as the extremely principle of camera surveillance. Video surveillance has come a long way, covering a number of years. The very first video surveillance system was a Closed-Circuit Tv (CCTV) set up in 1942 by German scientists to monitor the launch of rockets. The innovation gradually evolved into the extremely advanced yet affordable systems readily available today. The first usages of CCTV cameras required monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and view it later.
