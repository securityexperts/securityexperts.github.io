<p>Like the Nest Camera IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize individuals the camera is spotting utilizing face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to identify those individuals and will send mobile phone alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to differentiate expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Cam Outdoor's one) also supply a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
