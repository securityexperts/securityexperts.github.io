The camera could legally do what a peeping tom might not do. They might peer within windows with the full protection of the law on their side.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face notifies, which can identify people the camera is finding using face acknowledgment. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify anticipated visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was always asking us to determine faces on a close-by TV). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a broader variety of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
