<p>Like the Nest Webcam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can recognize people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you know that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to recognize those people and will send out smartphone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We think this feature (which needs a Nest Aware subscription) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are most likely to wish to identify expected visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a neighboring TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger variety of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
