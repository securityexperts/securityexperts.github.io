<p>Slightly more costly than our winning clever alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, during screening, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if one of the sensors had been set off. We like that the system includes a wifi security camera and only informs you when motion is created by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no false informs). Nevertheless, you do need to register for the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to see recording from the wifi security camera and get informs on your phone if the sensors have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are available that have extra sensors and essential fobs, too.</p>
