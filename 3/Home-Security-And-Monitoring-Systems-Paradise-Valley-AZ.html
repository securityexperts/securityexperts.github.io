<p>CCTV cameras are positioned in locations where they are believed to be most reliable, which usually includes extremely populated towns, city centers, parking lot, or various other high-crime locations (Welsh and Farrington 2008). Given that the positioning of these cameras is extremely essential, the crime patterns in locations of interest are generally studied for periods of time to recognize criminal offense hotspots where cameras could potentially be placed. In many cases, Geographic Info Systems technology is utilized to exactly assess criminal offense patterns for camera placement; however, the positioning of cameras can also be the result of input from policeman and other criminal justice stakeholders (La Vigne et al. 2011).</p>

<h3>Automated Home Security in Arizona</h3>
<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

If you're not mechanically likely, having a professional set up the system might give you more self-confidence than if you did the work yourself. Wireless cameras can't have everything-- watch things inside by day, and keep an eye on what's going on outside after dark. It hardly ever works.</p>
