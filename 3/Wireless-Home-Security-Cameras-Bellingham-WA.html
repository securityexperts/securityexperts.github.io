<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously excellent piece of innovation. For beginners, it looks gorgeous: the all-white style and black camera face are seriously spacey (if strangely reminiscent of the AI in 2001: A Space Odyssey). It's far from the ghastly metal CCTV box that you may call to mind when you picture a home security camera.

After a time, video can be compressed to conserve storage space, for example.</p>
