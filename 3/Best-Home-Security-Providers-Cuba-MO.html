<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, since it provides protection just when the wireless device is "off the air". Any 802.11 gadget "on the air" easily sends its unencrypted MAC address in its 802.11 headers, and it needs no unique equipment or software application to identify it.

In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just an incorrect sense of security considering that it avoids just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to avoid a directed attack.</p>
