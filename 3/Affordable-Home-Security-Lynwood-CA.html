<p>With modern burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your household will have the very best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you don't decide to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have recording storage and advanced features, such as notices that distinguish between individuals and basic motion. We think that's costly.</p>
