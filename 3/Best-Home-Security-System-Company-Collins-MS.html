<p>There's a lot to like about the Maximus Camera Floodlight, starting with its camera's crisp, clear 1080p video. Its dual articulating LED floodlights cover a really large area, and you can dim them through its app if you want mood lighting on your deck or outdoor patio for a celebration.

<p>The Google Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly sophisticated outdoor camera we have actually evaluated. It has a close-up tracking feature, which immediately focuses on motion and after that follows it around the field of view. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensing unit, HDR (high dynamic range), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between general motion and individuals, so it minimizes incorrect alarms, and it can even determine people you have actually labeled (after a learning duration).

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name recommends, is a kind of CCTV camera with a dome cover. However beyond that I simply had problems.
