Rugged Cameras has made security cameras and systems for companies and commercial environments for more than 25 years.</p>

<p>Seattle's primary intent with this law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies more accountable for incorrect alarms, and lower the number of unnecessary police and fire reactions. Alarm monitoring companies are the professionals and should be teaching their customers how to appropriately set and care for their alarm.
