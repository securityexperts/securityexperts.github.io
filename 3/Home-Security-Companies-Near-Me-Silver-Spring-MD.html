<p>With state-of-the-art alarm system systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from break-ins and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't rather as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor usage. It has a 10-foot power cord that restricts positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you do not choose to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to register for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have taping storage and advanced features, such as alerts that distinguish between people and basic motion. We believe that's pricey.</p>
