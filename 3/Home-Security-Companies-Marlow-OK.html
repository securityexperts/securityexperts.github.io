However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's reaction time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls should be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City needs verification from a personal security personnel. A number of cities likewise need a license to even operate a home and own security system.
