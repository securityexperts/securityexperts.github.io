<p>As far as the app goes, D-Link has plainly tried to give it an appealing edge, and we need to give credit to its capability to show what's going on from up to four cameras at a time. It can be awkward and sluggish to utilize on occasion - with the process of connecting to the camera for a live view rather sluggish sometimes. The previous, cheaper version of the outdoor Nest cam is still on sale too if you want to save some cash - it does have actually a cable connected however, instead of working wirelessly, which suggests it's a bit simpler to undermine for potential trespassers.
