<h3>Monitored Home Alarm Emporia VA 23847</h3>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor.
