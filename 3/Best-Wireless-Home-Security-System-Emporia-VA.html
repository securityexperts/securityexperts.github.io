<h3>Monitored Home Alarm Emporia VA 23847</h3>
<p>The Blink XT2 is small, runs on two AA batteries, and includes a year's worth of free cloud storage, and it catches a better image and longer clips than its predecessors. So why isn't it a choice? It still leaves a minimum of 11 seconds in between recordings, smartphone notices and live views were painfully sluggish, and the range is poor. Likewise, if the camera remains in the middle of recording, do not expect to get a live peek or make any settings changes-- it can't multitask.</p>
