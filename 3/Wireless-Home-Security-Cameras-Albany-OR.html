<p>Lighting: Numerous security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths show back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in an illuminated space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if recording footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>Security cameras do raise crucial privacy problems, because they can permit you to spy on family, friends, and anyone else who crosses the limit of your home, possibly without their permission. (For a much deeper look at prospective privacy and legal concerns, see our post Security Cameras, Ethics, and the Law") Purchasing a Wi-Fi camera should be a household decision in which positioning, usage, and watching is agreed upon by everybody worried, however that may also include sitters, housekeepers, and tradespeople, depending on local laws. This implies that deciding which camera is best for you might depend upon how obvious you desire it to be and what it will record. </p>
