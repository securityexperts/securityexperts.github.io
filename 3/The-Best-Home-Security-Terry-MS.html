<p>There is a new trend in surveillance video search technology that is quickly changing the security market, and it is called Deep Learning". What is Deep Knowing and why is it so crucial?  For starters, Deep Learning allows somebody to find what they are looking for without having to explore hours of worthless video footage.  Picture a web page that works a lot like a Google search, where you can explain the elements you are looking for in the tape-recorded video footage.  For instance, if we need to see all video from today that has a police vehicle in it, we just type authorities" into the search window and in seconds every secret frame of video with a police cruiser appears.  With deep knowing video search, you now have an effective solution for capturing lawbreakers and gathering proof.</p>
