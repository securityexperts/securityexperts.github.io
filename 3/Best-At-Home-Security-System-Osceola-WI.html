A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that can identifying small distinctions in temperature. The device gathers the infrared radiation from objects in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon information about the temperature level differences.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools offered which can launch a dictionary design attack of "perhaps accepted" security secrets based upon the "design" security essential captured during the network recovery.</p>
