<p>With advanced burglar alarm systems from Security Instrument, you and your family will have the best defense possible from burglaries and theft. We found the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Cam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cord that limits placement, and it isn't weatherproof (you can add a weatherproof cord, however doing so makes each unit cost more than a single Nest). Likewise, if you do not opt to utilize HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 regular monthly Circle Safe subscription to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as alerts that compare people and basic motion. We think that's expensive.</p>

<p>Dome IP camera, as the name suggests, is a kind of CCTV camera with a dome cover. But beyond that I simply had problems. The switch from daylight to night vision took about 5 minutes (though it worked fine changing from night to day.) The motion detector is bad. I was carrying out the macarena in front of the camera for about two minutes before it even observed I was there. </p>
