<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short explanation of how thermal cameras work: All items emit infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy produced by an object is known as its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an object is, the more radiation it discharges.

<p>A wired security system was the first type of security system that was created for homeowners. It should be set up by an expert alarm installation group and, when set up, is tough to move from one place to another.
