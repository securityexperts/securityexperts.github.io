Use a desktop, laptop, tablet or choose smart device to gain access to documented and live video coverage from a secure IP connection.</p>
<p>Registered for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.

I do not advise SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.
