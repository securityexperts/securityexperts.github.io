<p>The Frontpoint Security system, in addition to its Interactive strategy, was our favorite home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are almost similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are a little more pricey for the very same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation costs are burdensome, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer suggest anyhow.</p>
<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially innovative, so we're really advising the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will likewise like Nest's contract-free plan option. Sure, you get a lower rate if you go with a three-year agreement, but given that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your staying contract if you cancel, it's a huge dedication. So pick what will be the much better offer for you. Go with the contract and enjoy those cost savings if you know you'll remain put for at least 3 years. However if you might update to a new office with different security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
