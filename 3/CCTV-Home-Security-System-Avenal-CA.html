<p>The Nest IQ is a seriously remarkable piece of technology. For beginners, it looks stunning: the all-white design and black camera face are seriously spacey (if eerily reminiscent of the AI in 2001: An Area Odyssey). It's far from the horrid metal CCTV box that you may recollect when you think of a home security camera.

The Deep Sentinel is unlike every other home security camera. That's because when the camera spot an intruder, it sends out a live feed to a monitoring station, where a specialist can sound an alarm on the camera, yell a warning, and if needed, contact the cops.</p>
