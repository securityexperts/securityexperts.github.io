<p>Smart alarms are just as effective as traditional burglar alarms but they do not always have an external siren that rests on the front of your house, which can function as a deterrent to intruders. While most wise alarms use optional monitoring services, they're not as thorough as those used by standard alarms, which often dispatch the authorities if the alarm has actually been triggered and not confirmed as a false alarm.</p>
<p>Video and image feeds have proved indispensable for surveillance - but there's room for more functionality by using audio. People have 5 senses that collectively permit us to accurately vary our environment. For that reason, it just makes sense that a security system that engages as numerous senses as possible is more effective. And due to the fact that it's not useful to engage touch, taste, and smell from another location, the most effective video surveillance systems combine sight and hearing to boost security protection.</p>
