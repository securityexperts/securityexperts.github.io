The other approach is to rip and replace, performing a complete upgrade to a new security system that currently has all the existing system requirements plus the capability to assemble them all.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively translate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
