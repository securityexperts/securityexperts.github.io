With this in mind, video surveillance is the act of observing something with the aid of electronic monitoring and video recording.

With a wireless system, you can also receive push alerts on your phone or tablet that let you understand there is a problem, even when you're not in the house.</p>

We likewise discovered the function to be more reputable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor design, this feature was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TV). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Webcam Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
