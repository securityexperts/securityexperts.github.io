<p>One crucial exception: ADT has a landline monitoring plan that's $36.99 monthly, which could be an inexpensive choice for clients in rural areas. We recommend cellular systems due to the fact that they're far more secure than landline systems, but there are some places where cellular monitoring isn't readily available. A landline system is still much better than no security at all if you live somewhere without access to cellular monitoring.</p>
