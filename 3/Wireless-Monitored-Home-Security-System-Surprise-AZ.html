I called their customer support team and they acknowledged that the sales individuals do not need to mention it, it's on you to read the fine print. I'm paying the swelling amount, since obviously they vehicle restore you eventually unless you nail the timing.  There are reports of needing to send in a written not by mail.

When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy.
