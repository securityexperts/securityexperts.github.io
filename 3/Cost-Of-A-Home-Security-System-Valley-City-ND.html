<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

<p>Surveillance systems present police "bad apples" with a tempting opportunity for criminal abuse.

If you have an analog security camera system, then the digital video recorder (DVR) that the security cameras are connected to has a disk drive within it.

<p>These cameras are capable of catching and sending extremely sensitive information," states Cody Feng, a test engineer at CR's Digital Lab. That's why we check them for information security and information privacy. Surveillance is the act of monitoring something or somebody, mainly to spot or prevent criminal activity.

<p>Due to the fact that they work using a digital signal which can be conserved straight to a computer, these cameras do not require a video capture card. The signal is compressed 5:1, but DVD quality can be attained with more compression (MPEG-2 is basic for DVD-video, and has a higher compression ratio than 5:1, with a slightly lower video quality than 5:1 at best, and is adjustable for the quantity of space to be taken up versus the quality of picture needed or wanted). The greatest picture quality of DVD is just somewhat lower than the quality of basic 5:1- compression DV.</p>
