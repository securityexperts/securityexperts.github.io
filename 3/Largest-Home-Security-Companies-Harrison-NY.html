<p>Costs for systems vary. Larger systems that offer full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most expensive options. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most inexpensive choice. Remember that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end.
