The equipment required for the wired system tends to be a bit more affordable than the wireless systems. While this may seem appealing initially, think about all of the disadvantages to the wired systems that we have actually currently discussed.

<p>After testing lots of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for the majority of people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is completely wireless, and can be set up both indoors and out, as it's weather condition resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint doesn't have an agreement, and its equipment rates is very affordable, so it's not an overall splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>
