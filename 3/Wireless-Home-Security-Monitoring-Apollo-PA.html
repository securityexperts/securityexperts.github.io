<p>Multiple screens were set up within the new command center with a single monitor appointed to alarm displays. When any alarm system incorporated into the PCU was activated, the nearby camera to that location would be shown on that specific monitor. The chance that the fixed camera would be pointed in the direction of the incident depends upon the initial requirements for area of coverage. If there are three choose fire escape, panic alarms, or door sensing units, a single fixed camera can just view one.

When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut.

Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be moved.
