<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the extreme environment.</p>
<p>We have examined numerous essential reasons one ought to consider commercial-grade cameras so far, however, we have actually just skimmed the surface of the topic. In today's network-connected world, a surveillance system is rarely a stand-alone system. If your proposed camera system will integrate with other products, it is worth understanding. </p>
