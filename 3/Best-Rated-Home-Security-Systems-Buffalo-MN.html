<p>The main intent of the law is to hold alarm-monitoring companies and their clients more accountable for false alarms, and decrease the number of unnecessary cops and fire actions. When reacting to false or unintentional alarms, the fees offset the costs to the Seattle Cops and Fire Departments. More than 98 percent of all burglar and home alarms ultimately show to be false alarms.</p>
<p>What truly sets this design apart is Nest Aware, a membership service that can be costly but is necessary. In fact, we do not advise purchasing this camera at all unless you plan to add the membership. Without it, you won't get the person-detection function, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated locations within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a detailed, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera found activity. Having the ability to compare an automobile and a person, for instance, permits you to reduce unnecessary notifies. And Activity Zones are a great perk, especially if you're aiming to monitor a specific corner of the lawn, a doorway, or even garbage cans. </p>
