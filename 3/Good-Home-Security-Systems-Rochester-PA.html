In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls must be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

<p>When utilizing IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do these days - you will most likely be taking a look at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can transfer the big quantity of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely fast speeds, and typically over fars away.

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will likewise power the security cameras, removing the requirement for further circuitry.

Wireless security cameras might require less wiring in the walls however will still need cables to power the security camera separately, normally through 110VAC power. </p>
