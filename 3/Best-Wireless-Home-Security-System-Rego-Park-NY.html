Unless you only have one door and one window, you'll need more than the only contact sensing unit that comes in Ring's five-piece set.</p>

It costs a lot, its prices isn't constantly transparent, and it still has long contracts. Not to point out that the customer support experience differs widely depending upon the dealership you go with. </p>
