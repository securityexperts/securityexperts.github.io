<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely normal considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, when customers understand that the low-cost consumer camera they purchased is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
