<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system discovers a burglary, fire, or other emergency, it informs the security group and, in many cases, emergency responders. Unfortunately, history has shown that surveillance technologies put in place for one function undoubtedly expand into other uses. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the absence of any clear limits for what CCTV systems must have the ability to do poses a substantial risk.</p>
