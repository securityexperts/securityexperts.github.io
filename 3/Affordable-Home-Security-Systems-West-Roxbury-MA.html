<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face alerts, which can recognize people the camera is finding using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you know that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will learn to recognize those people and will send smart device alerts with that info when they appear at your home.

We likewise discovered the feature to be more dependable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ design (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) also offer a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
