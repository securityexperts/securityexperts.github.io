<p>Another consideration with wireless home security systems is the limited series of sensors. The majority of radio frequencies are weak outside a variety of 500 feet.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to effectively equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clarity succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
<p>For example, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies designed their equipment this way to make consumers stay with them longer, due to the fact that switching monitoring companies indicates numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for customers. Alexa support is included, as you would expect from an Amazon-owned brand name, and the camera properly deals with all the typical functions when it comes to motion detection and two-way audio. Night vision is included too, for when the lights head out. </p>
