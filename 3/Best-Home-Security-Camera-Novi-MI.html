<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine people the camera is spotting utilizing face acknowledgment. When it identifies an individual in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will discover to determine those individuals and will send out mobile phone alerts with that details when they show up at your home. We think this function (which requires a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are most likely to want to distinguish expected visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the function to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this feature was constantly asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also provide a larger range of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
