Because this camera has no native geofencing functions, you have to manually stop notifications (and recording, because it does that even when notifications are off). We also experienced above-average connectivity problems, with two Hive test units detaching eight times over two months.</p>

However I likewise appreciate minimalist systems that components that perform more than one action, like Minut. Some parts can make home automation readily available to you.
