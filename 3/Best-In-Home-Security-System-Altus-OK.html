<p>It deals with a wire or without, with a Canary Smart base station or without, and can operate indoors or inside - you get a great deal of flexibility from this little device. We like the 1080p HD video quality, the 116-degree field of vision, the motion detection, and the detachable magnetic base which is basic to install. That's simply $0.66 a day (or about $20 a month) for basic home security equipment and the peace of mind of professional monitoring.</p>
<p>What really sets this model apart is Nest Aware, a subscription service that can be costly but is essential. In reality, we don't suggest purchasing this camera at all unless you prepare to add the membership. Without it, you will not get the person-detection feature, customizable Activity Zones (which let you monitor designated areas within the camera's field of vision), or Sightline, a comprehensive, scrollable timeline of when and where the camera spotted activity. Being able to distinguish between a car and an individual, for example, enables you to cut down on unnecessary informs. And Activity Zones are a great perk, specifically if you're wanting to monitor a particular corner of the yard, an entrance, and even garbage cans. </p>
