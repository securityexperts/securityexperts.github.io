<p>The disadvantage to a wireless system is that it relies on a wireless signal, implying that storms and strong winds have the power to interfere with the system and might even activate false alarms. Incorrect alarms are known to be more common with wireless security systems than with wired ones and they might lead to fines from the provider or the authorities if they take place frequently enough. Another potential drawback to wireless security is that the batteries on each tool need to be replaced or charged frequently in order to keep the system working. Wireless equipment can also be more pricey than the equipment for a wired security system, though that is usually offset by the truth that there are no installation expenses.</p>
