<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this model has Familiar Face signals, which can identify people the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send out mobile phone alerts with that information when they show up at your home. We believe this feature (which requires a Nest Aware subscription) is more beneficial outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also found the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to identify faces on a nearby TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) likewise supply a wider range of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
