<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching.

We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy.
