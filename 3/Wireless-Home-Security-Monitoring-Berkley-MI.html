<p>Contact among our security specialists with any concerns you may have about home alarm monitoring. While it may come as a surprise, burglar alarms have actually been around for over 150 years. In reality, the 2nd half of the 19th century was a duration of terrific development in the security market. The first home alarm system was patented in 1853 by a Bostonian innovator called Augustus Russell Pope.</p>
<p>The potential value of public surveillance technology was well demonstrated all the method back in April, 2013 when private investigators determined the two suspects in the Boston Marathon battle after sifting through video images captured by the city's cameras.

Wireless security systems are more agile and integratable, but low signal strength and bad connectivity are still common problems. Hardwired systems require minimal upkeep, and short of a basic power outage, are more difficult to interfere with. In spite of a basic improvement in wireless technology, there appear to be fewer ways for hardwired systems to be interrupted and incapacitated. </p>
