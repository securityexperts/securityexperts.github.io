<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal considering that the doorway and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone going into the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the economical consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>
