<p>I have this camera attached to my desktop computer as part of my home surveillance system. With the long USB cable, I was able location the camera around 10 feet far from my desk aiming into my hallway. The security program I use is "blue iris" which had the ability to find the camera without trouble. The IR lights at night are able to throw light a good 20 feet in a tight circle. Not as dispersed as I would like. It's not almost as clear as my foscam F9821P, nor is the lighting as good, however it was half the price and it does not consume my wifi bandwidth.</p>

<p>Now I pointed out this seemed like a stretch considering previous Sims games had robbers, but my pal explained the Sims 4 was produced a new generation, with a group of manufacturers surrounded by people OF that generation who would explain that the intrusion of their home or safe location could produce sensations of pain or possible even activating. Indirectly I can see his point, I have actually been playing games for a very long time and a great deal of the things in earlier games I have actually played a decade earlier would certainly NEVER make the cut in todays politically charged video gaming environment.</p>

<p>If I liked the look of the Nest, then I like the Hive View's style - definitely the most aesthetically pleasing camera on this list.
