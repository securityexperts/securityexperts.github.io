<p>Lighting: Many security cameras have the ability to shoot in what is known as "low-light infrared," allowing them to catch clear video in dark conditions. These cameras rely on infrared LED lights, which cover the dark area in infrared light. Unlike humans, the camera is able to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting footage in a lit up room. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the much better it has the ability to see during the night. Make sure your camera has plenty of IR LEDs if catching video footage in the dark is a concern.</p>
<p>We attempted each of the cameras in numerous places around our house, ranging from 6 feet to 30 feet far from our Wi-Fi router, which was linked to Verizon Fios service.
