<p>The Frontpoint Security system, together with its Interactive plan, was our preferred home security system from 2013 to early 2016. Its equipment, monitoring strategies, and features are practically similar to those of the Brinks system. However, Frontpoint's strategies are somewhat more pricey for the exact same level of service, its agreements are longer, its cancellation fees are burdensome, and its prices is less transparent than that of the Brinks system, which we no longer advise anyway.</p>
<p>Another advantage to monitored systems is if you purchase a monitored security strategy, the exact same company that keeps track of the system will install it for you.

Nevertheless, in exchange, they will need you to sign a long-term monitoring contract. For that reason, you will require to be going to sign a long-term agreement and pay for that service. </p>
