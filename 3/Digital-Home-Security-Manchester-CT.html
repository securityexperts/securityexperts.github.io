<p>After testing dozens of wired and wireless choices, the best home security camera for most people is the Arlo Pro 2. It tape-records high-definition, 1080p video both day and night, is fully wireless, and can be established both indoors and out, as it's weather resistant. Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment rates is very sensible, so it's not a total splurge. However you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the similarity Vivint or Brinks.</p>

<p>If you use Alexa to manage the wise lights in your home, then you should consider checking out Alexa Guard, a fairly new home security mode with a number of cool techniques. After turning Guard Mode on in the Alexa app's settings, simply state, "Alexa, I'm leaving" as you go out the door to activate it. From there, Alexa will cycle your lights on and off to make it look like you're home - and you'll also get a notification if your Echo speakers hear the noise of an alarm, or broken glass.</p>
<p>The Nest Camera Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were excellent in our screening-- during the day and at night-- with a broad, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that allowed us to get a closer view in live video. We should note that the camera would periodically downgrade the image quality based on readily available bandwidth, which could vary throughout the day. Nest includes the option to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, however that may beat the function of having a 1080p camera.</p>
