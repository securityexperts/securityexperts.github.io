When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends out double signals: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the central patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the central patient-monitoring command center got a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk patient left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the risk and, if needed, could simply press an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that particular floor.</p>
