<p>The Google Nest Camera IQ Outdoor is the most technically innovative outdoor camera we have actually checked. It has a close-up tracking function, which instantly zooms in on motion and after that follows it around the field of vision. To make those images clear, it has an 8-megapixel 4K sensor, HDR (high vibrant variety), and 12 x digital zoom. It can distinguish between basic motion and individuals, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even identify people you've identified (after a learning duration). But like all Nest cameras, this one requires the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
<p>When I eventually entered into the camera controls, I was fairly impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a strong night-vision mode, and all the app controls are relatively self-explanatory. You've got two-way audio, you can play tunes simply to let the individual being viewed know they're being seen, and you can choose to tape-record video or photos and save them to your smart device on a whim. </p>
