We initially observed Wyze since its super-cheap indoor security camera reminded us of Disney's WALL-E Once we attempted it out, it quickly became a personnel (and family and friends) favorite. I do not suggest SimpliSafe 3 as a self-monitored system. As a self-monitored system, it is nothing more than a noise maker.

The 2nd number tells you how resistant the camera is to moisture and ranges from 0 (no protection) to 9 (safeguarded against close quarters, high pressure spray downs from all angles).</p>
