These cameras depend on infrared LED lights, which cover the darkened area in infrared light. Unlike human beings, the camera has the ability to see this infrared light, so when those wavelengths reflect back, it's as if the camera is shooting video in a brightened space. The more IR LEDs that a camera has, the better it is able to see during the night. If capturing footage in the dark is a concern, make certain your camera has lots of IR LEDs.</p>
