<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Indoors, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
