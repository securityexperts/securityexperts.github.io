<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cables, which can move the big amount of data required by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and often over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that typically powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trustworthy, however not compatible with IP cameras. Oftentimes, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the requirement for further electrical wiring. This is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch when the security cameras are not connected to an NVR. Wireless security cameras may require less wiring in the walls but will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, generally by means of 110VAC power. </p>
