<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not particularly revolutionary, so we're actually recommending the security cameras here. Some small-business owners will also like Nest's contract-free strategy alternative. Sure, you get a lower cost if you opt for a three-year agreement, but considering that Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big dedication. So pick what will be the much better offer for you. If you understand you'll stay put for a minimum of three years, choose the agreement and reap those cost savings. However if you may update to a new office with different security requirements, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
