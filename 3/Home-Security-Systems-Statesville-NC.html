<p>Are privately owned, ran surveillance cameras to be dealt with the exact same way as public cameras? We also need to draw great lines about 'Who truly is viewing you'? 'Who owns that camera anyway'? Big brother? The Corporates? Or bugging neighbour? Who draws the line in between public interest and harassment? At the minute, nobody! The camera could lawfully do what a peeping tom could not do. They could peer inside of windows with the full protection of the law on their side. If a person was standing watching outside a window it might be a criminal offense, yet the exact same person could put a surveillance camera then from another location view an individual within the personal privacy of their home. Most importantly, it is not versus the penal code.</p>

You have actually got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the individual being seen understand they're being watched, and you can choose to record video or pictures and save them to your smart gadget on a whim. </p>
