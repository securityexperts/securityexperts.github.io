<p>Perhaps. It depends on which security company you select. Lots of professionally monitored home security systems need an agreement, and agreement length can range from three to five years. But today you'll find more home security alternatives than ever prior to that offer much shorter agreements and month-to-month (contract-free) terms-- especially if you can pay for equipment in advance.
