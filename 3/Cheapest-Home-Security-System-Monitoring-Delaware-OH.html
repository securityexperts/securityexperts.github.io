<p>Expenses for systems vary. Bigger systems that provide full-house coverage with professional monitoring are the most costly choices. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most inexpensive choice. Remember that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies.

<p>I explained that all we would require to do is tap into any one of the emergency call buttons, input into the Axis camera, which likewise included two-way audio, and that camera would become the interface into the VMS system. When a client presses the emergency situation button, it sends double alerts: one to the nurse calling station and the other to the main patient-monitoring command center, through the VMS. Additionally, if the main patient-monitoring command center received a motion detection alarm, showing that a high-risk client left her bed, the patient-monitoring operator would examine the threat and, if needed, might merely push an onscreen button to call the nursing station on that specific floor.</p>

Though Vivint's sensing units are wireless, the control board does require to be set up by a linked and expert to a power source.
