We discovered the Circle 2 isn't quite as good as the Nest Webcam for outdoor use. It has a 10-foot power cable that limits positioning, and it isn't weatherproof (you can include a weatherproof cable, but doing so makes each system cost more than a single Nest). Also, if you don't opt to use HomeKit Secure Video you'll need to sign up for a $10 month-to-month Circle Safe membership to have tape-recording storage and advanced features, such as notifications that compare people and basic motion. We think that's pricey.</p>

<p>Another benefit to monitored systems is if you buy a monitored security strategy, the same company that keeps track of the system will install it for you. Having an expert set up the system might offer you more confidence than if you did the work yourself if you're not mechanically inclined.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is the one of the very best tools for supervising your home. Its wire-free style, high-resolution video, and affordable cloud monitoring help it stand above the competition. Still, it's one of the most costly security cameras you can buy, so we think the Wyze Webcam Pan is a good alternative if you're aiming to save some dough.
