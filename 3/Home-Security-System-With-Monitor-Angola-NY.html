<p>Yes. There are self-monitored systems that admit to a home's security app to as much as 20 relative. However, shared monitoring isn't a feature readily available from all companies. Be sure to research the company's functions or speak with a representative directly if this is a high priority.

Frontpoint also recently added a streamlined security hub that learns your daily patterns and adjusts appropriately.
