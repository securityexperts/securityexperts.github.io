<p>Like the Nest Web Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face informs, which can determine people the camera is identifying using face recognition. When it finds a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that person and if so to tag them by name. After a while, the camera will find out to determine those individuals and will send smartphone signals with that info when they show up at your home. We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more rewarding outdoors, where you are more likely to want to distinguish predicted visitors from random strangers. We also discovered the feature to be more trusted on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor model, this function was constantly asking us to identify faces on a close-by TELEVISION). 3 microphones (versus the Nest Camera Outdoor's one) also supply a broader series of audio, so you can much better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
