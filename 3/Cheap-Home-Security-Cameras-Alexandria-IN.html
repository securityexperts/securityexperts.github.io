<p>Costs for systems vary. Bigger systems that use full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most pricey options. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most cost effective choice. Remember that cameras with two-way audio usually work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's happening on the other end. And while this is a quite standard function in indoor cameras, two-way audio is reasonably rare in outdoor security cameras.</p>
<p>Obviously, the apparent disadvantage to a wired security system is that the preliminary install can be expensive. If the system was not installed during the homebuilding process, setting one up might need drilling holes into walls, running new wires, patching drywall and getting to challenging spots that are sealed in attics or basements. Wired security systems are likewise susceptible to power blackouts. A lot of will have a backup battery system that switches on in the event of an outage, but long term blackouts will result in the system losing power.

Because these security systems are integrated into the home's circuitry, they are not portable and can't move with you.</p>
