<p>All of their consumers are given access to the app to remotely monitor and control their system.

Arlo Pros 2 might not provide as broad a variety of alarm gadgets as adobe Starter Set, but its camera is incredibly innovative and it can serve a number of functions at once.

<p>Like the Nest Cam IQ Indoor, this design has Familiar Face signals, which can determine individuals the camera is spotting using face recognition. When it identifies a person in the frame, it will ask whether you understand that individual and if so to tag them by name.

We think this function (which needs a Nest Aware membership) is more worthwhile outdoors, where you are more likely to wish to identify predicted visitors from random complete strangers. We also discovered the function to be more reliable on the IQ Outdoor than on the indoor IQ model (on the indoor design, this function was always asking us to recognize faces on a nearby TELEVISION). Three microphones (versus the Nest Web cam Outdoor's one) likewise supply a larger series of audio, so you can better hear what's going on in recordings. </p>
