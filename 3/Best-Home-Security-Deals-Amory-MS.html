Non-traditional networks such as individual network Bluetooth gadgets are not safe from hacking and should be considered as a security risk.

This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a number of tools readily available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security secrets based on the "model" security key caught throughout the network healing.</p>
