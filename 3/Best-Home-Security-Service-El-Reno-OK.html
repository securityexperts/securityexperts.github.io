When this electrical current is not being transferred it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which indicates if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door permits the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will activate.</p>
