<p>Expenses for systems vary. Bigger systems that offer full-house protection with expert monitoring are the most costly choices. Smaller, self-monitored systems are the most cost effective choice. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio generally work like walkie talkies. You push a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end.
