Cameras are pretty standard for self monitored alarm, especially because incorrect alarms is a very real possibility.</p>

Now, most security systems include a multitude of components, such as a base station, security camera, entry, motion, and glass break sensing units, a keypad, and key fobs, to name a few components.
