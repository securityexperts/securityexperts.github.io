<p>Monitored security systems are systems that are actively monitored by a professional home security company. When the system spots a burglary, fire, or other emergency, it notifies the security group and, in some cases, emergency responders. Sadly, history has shown that surveillance technologies put in location for one purpose inevitably expand into other uses. And with video technology likely to continue advancing, the lack of any clear limits for what CCTV systems should have the ability to do poses a considerable danger.</p>
<p>Criminal offense, Cost and Advantages: Public surveillance camera systems can be a cost-effective method to prevent, document, and reduce criminal offenses. For instance the cost savings connected with criminal offenses averted through camera systems in a city of USA saved over 4 dollars for every dollar invested in the innovation, while another city yielded a 50 cent return on the dollar. </p>
