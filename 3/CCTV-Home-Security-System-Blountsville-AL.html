<p>Six basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Possession protection devices are created to protect specific, concrete possessions, such as jewelry, paintings, money boxes, and family heirlooms. These gadgets can be equipped with anti-tampering technology to prevent being deactivated. If the product to which the device has actually been connected is moved or interrupted, the sensor will set off an alarm.</p>
