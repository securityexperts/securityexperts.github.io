Frontpoint's monitoring prices are a little high compared to other systems out there. We like that Frontpoint does not have an agreement, and its equipment prices is super sensible, so it's not a total splurge. But you will pay more for Frontpoint monitoring than you would for the likes of Vivint or Brinks.</p>

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely normal given that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everybody getting in the shop.

Wireless keypads and keychains so you can control your alarm system from anywhere inside or near your business. </p>
