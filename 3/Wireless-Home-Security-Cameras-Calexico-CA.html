<h3>Wireless Surveillance Camera in Calexico CA</h3>

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless package analyzer can get the MAC address of any sending 802.11 within range. In an organizational environment, where most wireless devices are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering offers just a false complacency given that it avoids only "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational facilities and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
