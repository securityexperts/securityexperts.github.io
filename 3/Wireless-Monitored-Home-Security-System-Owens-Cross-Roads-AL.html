<p>Cameras with built in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near to the NVR is certainly something to be taken into consideration. For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on second story wall, this would trigger a disruption in the signal. A wireless bridge is an excellent option for long variety scenarios where poles and trees are not present.</p>
<p>Due to the fact that it's more complex than it should be, we do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, informs, and integration all need different IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
