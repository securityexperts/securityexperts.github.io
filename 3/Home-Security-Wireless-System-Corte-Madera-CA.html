The implicit justification for the current push to increase video surveillance is the risk of terrorist attacks. However suicide assaulters are plainly not prevented by camera - and might even be attracted to the television protection cameras can ensure - and the expense of a comprehensive video surveillance system such as Britain's - which draws up roughly 20 percent of that country's criminal justice budget plan - far surpasses the restricted benefits that the system might offer in investigating attacks or tried attacks after the truth (see truth sheet on Surveillance Cameras and the Attempted London Attacks ).</p>
