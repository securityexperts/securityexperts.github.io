<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with an unique light-handling function. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks entirely typical considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late given that the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
