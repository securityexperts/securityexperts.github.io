<p>MAC filtering works only for small residential (SOHO) networks, given that it offers protection just when the wireless device is "off the air".

Anybody with an 802.11 receiver (laptop computer and wireless adapter) and a freeware wireless packet analyzer can acquire the MAC address of any transmitting 802.11 within variety. In an organizational environment, where most wireless gadgets are "on the air" throughout the active working shift, MAC filtering supplies just a false complacency since it prevents just "casual" or unintentional connections to the organizational infrastructure and does nothing to prevent a directed attack.</p>
